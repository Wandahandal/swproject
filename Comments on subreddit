0,"“I’m not in charge of contraceptives”
“I can see that”

Had me cracking up"
1,Strauss and Oppenheimer both being served career implosions at the same exact time to represent mutually assured destruction was genius.
2,"“Maybe they were talking about something more… important”

What a great “go fuck yourself” moment. All the self-importance just gone. RDJ killed it in this role"
3,"Academy award ""Best Actor"" winners Casey Affleck, Gary Oldman and Remi Malek have total screen time of about 5 minutes."
4,Some guy in front of me went for a bathroom break with 15 minutes left. He sat there for 2h45m but just couldn’t make it. Brutal timing lol
5,"Oppenheimer: I’m so conflicted about my creation. Ah and angst of genius!

Teller: you know this is just the fuse for a bigger bomb I wanted to make"
6,"My brother said that Gary Oldman just needs to play Stalin now and he’ll have played all three world leaders who were at Potsdam. 

Nolan seriously pulled every string possible for casting in this. It’s amazing how he knew how all of the people he’s worked with before in their secondary roles would be able to fit together into the puzzle, but that’s part of what makes his films enjoyable. David Krumholtz’s physical transformation caught me off guard, and Rami Malek having no lines until the (verbal) bomb drops at the end was outstanding."
7,"Casey Affleck was terrifying in the small screen time we saw him.

Got Sociopathic CIA vibes from his character"
8,"The ending scene tying back into the raindrops hit me so damn hard. Good job Nolan you are the man, never stop making movies."
9,My man Gödel talking about the structure of trees while everybody's trying to blow the world up was my favourite part of the film.
10,"Normal people during sex: Oh yeah oh baby

Nerds during sex: I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"
11,I liked Kitty’s line of “you don’t get to sin and make everyone feel sorry for you.” After he found out Tatlock died
12,“Don’t let that crybaby back in.” Holy shit Truman was an asshole. He was on screen for less than 5 minutes and was somehow the worst person in the movie.
13,"The scene after the bomb goes off and he’s addressing the crowd will haunt me for some time, I can’t remember feeling so uncomfortable in a theatre. I can’t wait to see it again, absolutely incredible spectacle from start to finish"
14,"Florence Pugh showed up and got naked, then killed herself. That scene where Oppie’s wife is imagining Pugh just riding her husband, that was something I never thought I’d see in a Nolan film. It was almost Ari Aster like."
15,"""I believe we did""

Those final shots just made my heart sink. Even knowing the history I wasn't prepared to be so emotionally drained after this."
16,"I love the use of ripples on water to represent nuclear bombings like how they have drawn the blast radiuses on the map. In the end, during Einstein and Oppenheimer's encounter, it was drizzling, and endless ripples formed on the lake."
17,Emily Blunt’s character answering questions from Roger Robb and not falling for any of his bullshit was a great scene.
18,The feeling in my theater was palpable after the Trinity Test was successful and everyone on the ground was cheering its success. I don’t know how to describe it but it was kind of out of body to see almost a time capsule of people from 80 years ago celebrating the creation of something that could be the death of myself or my children in the future. Really chilling scene.
19,"“Do you want them to tar and feather you in the hopes they’ll forgive you for what you’ve done?”

Emily Blunt delivering the most scathing condemnation of Oppenheimer’s character and actions was so fucking powerful. Mix that in with her portrayal of postpartum depression, a mother and wife resigned to be nothing but a caretaker in the shadow of an ego driven, neurotic, anxiety filled genius and then a powerhouse fighter in the hearing, I think she was a real highlight for me. 

The film was way more humanising of Oppenheimer then I was thinking it’d be but also so much more damning of him than I’d ever thought it would be."
20,"“Maybe they weren’t talking about you at all… maybe something, more important” leading up to the final scene was a great line. The wince from Downey as the door opens and he’s hit with the sound of the reporters waiting to tear him down further."
21,"Ends with American Prometheus realizing the full scope of what still may come to pass.

This movie was fantastic. RDJ gave one hell of a fucking performance in the final act of the movie. As did everyone, regardless of their screen time throughout. Cillian Murphy conveyed so much through his role id be surprised if he didn't win best actor. Emily Blunt gave one hell of a performance and the shot of her reliving her husband's infidelity during the clearance interview was artistically beautiful. A great ""show, don't tell"" moment.

The fact that the pace starts and never really never let's up, but has moments of built tension that doesn't release, and moves on to save for later, makes it feel like it also never speeds up either. Its a marathon, but its paced so well its like you were trained for that marathon. My body felt the three hour run time, but my mind didn't. 

The ending was also beautiful shot, from almost every aspect. RDJ slowly making his way towards Oppenheimer and Einstein, to the content of that teased conversation, to the way it ended."
22,Why did Nolan tease JFK like the joker card from Batman Begins
23,Haven’t seen anyone talk about Matt Damon yet…I think he did an incredible job
24,The last scene with Oppenheimer and Einstein made my stomach launch into my throat
25,Emily Blunt's character where it looks like she's starting to break down and the sudden 180 during the questioning was amazing. Standing her ground and not falling for bait questions.
26,Like many people the ending to this movie is absolutely incredible! Ending with Einstein & Oppenheimer was genius and it gave me literal chills! Nolan’s best in years
27,"For a 3 hour heavy dialogue film to have this type of speed to it is incredible. Honestly it was hard to distinguish where scenes began and ended with it's editing and pacing. It just did not stop and I loved it. It cuts to a single shot for a split second, then back to the scene, then forward to another, then backwards again while in colour for a first person perspective then to a black and white objective perspective with the music swelling along while all being coherent."
28,"The scene where Strauss is told something along the lines of ""Maybe they were talking about more IMPORTANT things"" had me grinning ear to ear. Oh my god"
29,"Question about the scene where >! A character drowns themselves in a bathtub, was there certain shots in this sequence that showed another pair of hands drowning them ? IE implying it could’ve been murder ? !< 

Anyway, enjoyed the film, reminded me a lot of Oliver Stones ‘Nixon’ that I love.. it’s missing Stones sense of paranoia though"
30,I believe we did. 💀
31,"Didn't know Josh Peck was going to be in it, that was a funny and pleasant surprise"
32,"That scene after the bombs have been dropped and Oppenheimer is addressing that classroom of people was one of the most haunting things I’ve seen. The way the background shook, and the flash burned the audience, mixed with the silence was something else."
33,"The biggest thing for me was, just how impactful the first explosion was to the people that were there doing the testing.

They weren’t just creating another bomb, but something terrifying, world ending stuff. 

Nolan really gets that across to the audience. Impactful stuff.

But the size of the explosion threw me off. Because you see stuff [like this](https://youtu.be/NofLHhxHwYk) and the close up shots of the buildings being destroyed, [like this](https://youtu.be/DXg2P9dx-GM).


But to realize a nuclear explosion is just [this](https://youtu.be/8PJEpeU00eU) when viewed from afar, I can now totally see the scale Nolan was going for. It never really occurred to me just how almost simple the explosion could be portrayed, I never put a lot of thought into it. But it’s still so horrifying in its destructiveness."
34,I was genuinely surprised when I saw Rami Malek. Didn't know he was here.
35,Ludwig Göransson might be approaching a Hans Zimmer level of film composer. The way he orchestrated the score adds so much to the tension and anxiety of the movie. Hopefully he picks up the Oscar
36,"For the physics folks here, Feynman and his repeated scenes with the bongos cracked me up. Jokes aside, Nolan outdid himself and it lived up to the hype for me."
37,It’s hilarious that the nude scene that everybody made so much out of even included the Destroyer of Worlds Bhagavad Gita quote.
38,Anyone else catch the black gloved hand in the corner of the frame during the tatlock “suicide” scene? In the Bird/Sherwon book there is a suggestion that she was murdered. I thought this was an interesting way of visualizing the ambiguous circumstances of her death.
39,"I found Emily Blunt's portrayal of Kitty Oppenheimer particularly compelling and it was amazing how complete a character she was in such limited time. During her limited screentime she showed:

* Vulnerability - post partum depression

* Compassion - Robert tells her about Jean

* Determination - telling Robert to fight

* Wisdom - reasoned it was Strauss

* Strength - the only one that really made Roger Robb struggle"
40,"One thing I think I missed during the movie was in the beginning when they brought the titles for:
1. Fission
2. Fusion

I thought this would come back and it didn’t. Anyone have an understand of what that meant? Does it have to do something with the color vs black and white. Could have missed something really basic."
41,"No one talking about him,

But Jason Clarke as Roger Robb in the interrogation scenes was genuinely brilliant. Just such an amazing performance all round from the whole cast."
42,The dead silence in the theater during the trinity explosion. Something I’ll never forget experiencing in a full theater.
43,They played the trailer to The Exorcist Believer before this movie 🤣
44,"I loved how that constant stomping noise is used to make you feel terror, you’re afraid anytime you hear it and then it’s revealed that the terrifying sound, is a crowd of people cheering for Oppenheimer. It makes it even more scary"
45,"Christopher Nolan has perfectly encapsulated what anxiety can feel like. Claustrophobic, loud, and unrelenting."
46,"Our 70mm showing stopped working 2.5 hours into the film! A light bulb or something broke. We had a little 10 min intermission, and got free tickets bc of it! Overall one of Nolan's best films."
47,He always answered because there was no caller ID back then.
48,"No, Strauss, you’re not important enough to be discussed by Oppenheimer and Einstein."
49,"Cillian Murphy's haunting look at several key points of the film is just amazing. That final conversation with Einstein, his stare is immense and powerful"
50,"Did anyone else notice that when Strauss is retelling the story of Oppenheimer embarrassing him, he laughs along with everyone else, but later in the movie when they show it, he’s completely stone-faced."
51,"Seen it twice now already. Trinity test scene was remarkable and what most people will see the film for, but there are so many other great scenes. Some of my favorite:

- **""Can you hear the music, Robert?""** The scene where Oppenheimer is told to leave Cambridge and we seem him abroad, looking at art, thinking of the quantum world, all while the beautiful score is played. Such a beautiful montage. It happens early so it's somewhat over shadowed by the later scenes, but make no mistake I think it's one of the best in the film.

- The dinner with Strauss, where they are discussing whether or not there was a spy at Los Alamos and if the Soviets have an H-bomb. I love this sequence, I love the way the music swells, the back and forth between Strauss and Oppenheimer, and how the scene ends with Oppenheimer says something to the effect of ""there was no spy"" and Strauss holds up the data sheet and says ""Robert."" RDJ delivery of that line was like music. I love how everything was played during that scene and how it all culminates with RDJ's delivery of that line. 

- **""I'm taking Kyoto off the list, due to it's cultural significance to the Japanese people. Also my wife and I honeymooned there.""** Fantastic and harrowing scene where they discuss how and where to effectively use the bomb. James Remar is particularly great. 

- The gymnasium scene, after they learned of the Horishima bombing. This was Nolan directing a horror film. First of all I loved the use of a wide open aperture during this scene, as it gave the scene a very shallow depth of field, resulting in a dream like/nightmare like appearance. This might be Cillian's best scene in the film, watching Oppenheimer dissociate from the jubilation of the crowd, as the reality around him begins to break down, as the destruction and death he was responsible for begins to truly sink in. I love how flat his ""rah-rah"" speech is. And the use of sound here is tremendous. The stamping of the feet, the sound of the crowd going out, the sound of a woman screaming, the crowd noise slamming back in like a bomb itself. 

- The whole last hour is great, but the sequence where Roger Robb is realllyyy starting to grill Oppenheimer and the blinding light begins to fill the room. Acting and editing here was just unreal. 

- The scene with Pash. Casey Affleck's line delivery is so soft spoken, yet unsettling. Really tense scene.

- **""You can use a shovel for atomic energy, in fact you do""** I loved that this film used a Rashomon style narrative where we see the same scene over and over again from different perspectives and subjectivity. One of my favorites was the scene where Oppenheimer ""humiliates"" Strauss in public over the isotopes. I love when we first see this scene, Strauss appears to take Oppenheimer's jabs with good humor, smiling and shrugging it off, but when the true nature of Strauss is revealed near the end of the film, we see this sequence again, and Strauss looks so angry and humiliated. Also Cillian's line delivery during these moments were so good. I just love how he says ""in fact you do!""



- The final scene where we learn what Oppenheimer and Einstein really said to each other that day. Nolan understands set up and pay off so well. You watch the film waiting for the reveal and it does not disappoint. The final moment with the vision of the nuclear holocaust, is incredibly bleak, but much of what Einstein says to Oppenheimer during before this is so sad and god damn poignant. Watching Oppenheimer as an old man receive a hollow award and receive handshakes and pats on the back from some of the men that stabbed him in the back or attempted to. The way Einstein sums up the burden of genius, but also the way you will be taken for granted as you age."
52,"Rami Malek's character (Hill?) was basically the opposite of Strauss. Strauss is met with two minor slights by Oppenheimer, one imagined, and makes it his mission to ruin his life. 

Hill was genuinely dismissed, maybe even bullied, by Oppenheimer multiple times but years later decides to essentially exonerate him in front of a congressional hearing."
53,"A film that feels like an enormous pop culture event while simultaneously being a 3 hour, dialogue heavy character study that extensively uses black and white photography. Watching such a film on a massive screen with a sold out crowd is honestly quite unbelievable. In this day in age we almost exclusively expect this for comic book movies and not much else. That thought alone genuinely brought me to the verge of tears multiple times. We just don’t get moments like this very often. Thankfully Oppenheimer is worthy of the moment."
54,He was so mean/dismissive to Rami’s character and yet he was the one who supported and back him up
55,"I knew nothing of the history between Oppenheimer and RDJ’s real life counterpart he was playing. So when in the 3rd act it’s revealed he’s the one orchestrating the campaign to ruin Cillian Murphy, I was STUNNED.

Legit the best twist I seen since LA confidential."
56,"I'm just gonna say that the bowls on the table filling up with marbles might be low-key one of my favorite plot devices. 

Most films would give some stupid exposition, try and explain something really fucking complex like bending a piece of paper and poking a hole through it or something. 

Not this film. Nolan just shows marbles filling in some bowls and keeps the film focused on what fucking matters. Brilliant."
57,The way my sphincter exploded like the bomb when the audio cuts back in during the gymnasium applause.
58,"The last 30 minutes could be its own movie lol, Oppenheimer getting slammed from everyone"
59,They made a avengers assemble movie for all the scientists but didn’t give them each solo movies to flesh out their characters. Also that Einstein guy seems like some bait for a prequel movie
60,That little mention of JFK voting against Strauss got a good chuckle out of me
61,"I love how Nolan played with the differences between the speed of light and sound during the Trinity Test. To convey an awe-inspiring visual spectacle only to be engulfed by the force/sound of it. 

The atomic bomb was a marvelous scientific achievement but then the magnitude of this creation and the harm it will cause literally hits you like a freight train. 

My whole theater was completely silent. It was awesome to be a part of."
62,The Soundwave after the detonation was a genuine jump scare in my screening last night. If felt like my packed Theater was all together in wonder at the explosion visuals that the blast sound shocked everyone back to reality.
63,"I fucking loved this movie. So much tragedy in this movie. Love Emily Blunts line that went something like just because you sin don't expect the world to feel sorry for you. Of course all the conversations with Einstein were great. 
Loved RDJ in the third act
Pacing and editing is so great.
I held my piss in the whole time.
Cillian Murphy and Emily Blunt need Oscar nods IMO.
Nolan did it again"
64,"It’s funny to think that the whole barbenheimmer trend is going to convince more than one casual film goer to see a three hour dialogue heavy biopic. It’s very good, Cillian Murphy is phenomenal, RDJ kinda hijacks in the third act but that’s alright I like him too, love Gary oldman’s new schtick of “I’m going to cover myself in some much rubber that even my mama won’t recognize me”"
65,I don’t think it can be understated how powerful that last scene between Einstein and Oppenheimer was. I was already blown away by the film but that scene will haunt me for the rest of my life. 10/10.
66,"Everyone praising Murphy and RDJ

Y'all 

Damon was excellent."
67,"Had to cancel my tickets for Barbie after, this was intense"
68,"Here are my main takeaways:
- There were a lot of generationally smart people on earth at the same time. Several names I recognized from textbooks that I didn’t realize knew each other and worked together. It could be because I’m not actively studying scientific journals, but it seems like we don’t have as many Einsteins, Bohrs, and Oppenheimers these days. 
- The movie had way more political undertones than I was expecting. Really highlighted that some of the madness we see in politics has existed for centuries."
69,The 5 minutes leading up to the bomb going off had my heart racing
70,"The thing that makes this movie incredible is I don't even know where to start with it. Albert Einstein is in just a few scenes and on film for what 5 minutes and the portrayal is amazing and wonderful and heartwarming. There's not a single bad performance in the movie. 

Oldman as Truman is awesome and bold because all Nolan does is portray Truman as he was. If you know history you know Truman is a good man/president and yet he comes off as a total asshole. It's remarkable. 

Downey and Murphy are 10/10. But so are so many others. Blunt is superb. Branaugh is in 2 scenes basically and he's effing incredible. 

The question of if we are doomed is so dark but powerful. And the way the movie used oppenheimer's imagination as surrealism and connects it back to him looking at art is...whew. it's just an awesome, awesome piece of art (the movie I mean). 

I'm a history teacher and I try to convey to students how big a deal the bomb is. It really is a break with the rest of our history as a species and arguably the most important thing we've ever done. It will either destroy us or send us total the stars. This movie summed up all my efforts at teaching this subject and then some."
71,More serious blockbuster summer movies that are for adults please
72,So the 15 minute full penetration sex scene… was not true…
73,I really gotta read all three volumes of *Das Kapital* in the original German so I can impress a cute psychiatrist at the next communist party I attend.
74,"Everyone acted their asses off in this movie but I will continue to think about Emily Blunt and RDJ's performances. Simply amazing.

Did anyone catch who played Truman? I think it was some nobody who's never been in a movie before..."
75,"
This movie has possibly created a world record by having the most number of Nobel Laureates on screen. (I counted atleast 10)."
76,"In my personal opinion the part that's meant to shake you is when oppenhiemer gives his speech when the war was announced over and the people were cheering, but he also sees the destruction the bomb causes. A crazy juxtaposition of the crowd not understanding the reality of the use of the bomb. The movie was really trying to show that oppenhiemer truly believed that once the bomb was dropped once the whole world would be horrified and he hoped would be the end of the destruction. So when he sees people drunk on patriotism he realized the chain reaction that would destroy the world was not a chemical reaction that he introduced but the chain reaction of drunk on power. Oppenhiemers ego made him feel godlike that he was all knowing and that he could create a peacetime, but when Truman blew him off and basically said I'm God, oppenhiemer thought the politics and power hungry forces of the world would bring it to its end. Probably why he seemed relieved that the soviets got the tech so that power in the world would be dichotomas 

Why the ending scene with Einstein should haunt you, is not any moral question of what was already done at that point but the understanding of the inevitably of science progressing and that each one of us has a responsibility of it after its here. We are the chain reaction, that's when Einstein understood that his legacy would be tainted with  the bomb because he started the chain reaction of understanding quantum mechanics. So the moral question leaving the theatre should be we need to take this big leaps in science discovery with the care it needs before it runs away. Makes you think about who you are voting for, how much tech you use, and how we use AI

The movie was a 10/10. But as an engineer that studied nuclear energy I am bit of a fanboy of the scientists involved (it was like the art rennisance but for science, the implications of discovery are still unraveling today ex. quantum computing in the age of AI)  I already understood the science and what was happening and it was rewarding to get into the head of oppenhiemer and the politics and moral questions he had as a man. Maybe the movie rewards you more if you know more heading into the film due to the pace. Brilliant character study of one of the world's most interesting people. He felt the music, he truly felt like a vessel of science and had higher Devine purpose."
77,Every single casting choice was on the fucking point.
78,"- Arguably one of Nolan’s tightest scripts. It felt concise for what it was trying to do, and has hardly any filler scenes. 

- RDJ was incredible. I liked how he was kind of Tony Stark-ish at first, and then he becomes more and more unlikable as it goes on. He’s the front runner for Supporting Actor this year, for sure.

- Matt Damon was an unsung highlight. He was hilarious, and always gave great line deliveries.

- Gary Oldman as Truman was a great cameo. He was such a prick in only 2 minutes of screen time.

- The Trinity Test scene was absolutely breathtaking. The tension, followed by the silence, followed by the sound was thrilling to experience.

- Holy shit, that scene with Oppenheimer giving the speech in the gym and he hallucinates the bomb going off on the crowd. Genuinely one of the most haunting scenes I’ve ever seen.

- The score was fantastic, Ludwig deserves a ton of credit for building up the intensity with his score."
79,I'm glad Nolan restrained himself from showing Hiroshima. Instead he showed Murphy's face who is emoting all the dread and remorse pretty well. The post Hiroshima speech is an all-timer scene.
80,3 hours of people just... talking. And I could have watched another 3 hours. What an incredible movie.
81,"I haven’t seen many comments on the score, Ludwig Göransson absolutely killed it. Love the string motif."
82,"During the scene with the bomb, I couldn't help but think how funny it would be if something went wrong and Josh Peck was forced to push the red button... Look up with a thousand yard stare and say... ""Megan..."""
83,"I watched the movie, I felt like this is the best Christopher Nolan movies in years, it felt massive with so many actors in here and yet felt intimate because, this movie peeled the layer of Oppenheimer that we've never seen before on big screen, Cillian Murphy stepped in to a lead role and he executed that so precisely, RDJ also gave memorable performance as Strauss, the antagonist for Oppenheimer.

I also felt like Nolan is firing on all cylinders in here, camera works, sound designs, score, script were all top notch."
84,"If I’m a Hollywood male actor under the age of 80 and I wasn’t in this movie, I’m calling my agent first thing tomorrow"
85,"""For I have become Josh Peck, the destroyer of worlds"""
86,"I just want to say, as a physicist I enjoyed the first half hourish of the movie immensely. The jokes about mathematics, experimental vs theoretical, and Oppenheimer staring at a board saying “yep that proves it” really tickled my fancy."
87,[deleted]
88,My favourite part was when Einstein showed up from behind a car like Master Oogway
89,"That Truman scene was harrowing.

Also Casey Affleck was scary as fuck."
90,"I'm sorry, but the first sex scene where THE LINE is read aloud was absolutely ridiculous.

The rest of the movie, 10/10.

Edit:

""Talk dirty to me Opie!""

""I HAVE BECOME DEATH THE DESTROYER OF WORLDS"""
91,Very excited to watch Nolan finally take home all the Oscars
92,"The trinity test is the biggest reverse card Nolan played on the audience ever.

Everybody was excited for the sound of the explosion and it turns out, the waiting in anxiety for 30 seconds for the sound to hit was the heaviest experience I ever had in a theatre. 300 people dead quiet, you see the explosion, you stop breathing, sweating, 30 seconds feel like 5 minutes.

I had a mini panic attack waiting for the explosion sound and at that point we did not care if the exposion was loud enough, we only cared for those 30 seconds of total silence, sweat and anxiety in hearing the detonation."
93,"My screening is about to start and apparently lots of parents didn't get the memo it's an R rated movie and brought their kids. I had Florence Pugh's titties being shown spoiled for me so this should be interesting. Will update.

Update: surprisingly not too big a deal, tamer than I thought it would be. Maybe some covered eyes from the parents but not 100% sure since the theater was dark."
94,"When they were counting down to the explosion, some dumbass shouted allahu akbar when i guess he assumed there would be a loud explosion. This was at the IMAX showing at the SF Metreon."
95,"One of the best parts that’s not directly movie related was the exact start time and no movie previews, at least for the IMAX 70mm shows. This should be standard if you watch any PLF (IMAX, Dolby Cinema etc). As for the movie, definitely the front runner for Best Picture and acting nods for Cillian Murphy and RDJ. Hope this leads to more lead roles for Murphy."
96,"The thing that stands out to me the most is how well the film portrays Oppenheimer as a truly complex character that remains sympathetic throughout. A really great performance from Cillian Murphy and an excellent narrative. 

I also loved the string theory visuals. They felt very real in a way that’s hard to describe even though it’s probably not scientifically accurate/known."
97,"I’m a fan of Nolan. I was so blown away, like many I imagine, the first time I saw *The Prestige* it changed how I viewed movies. I stuck with him through the years, and was continued to be blown away. 

*Oppenheimer* is a larger than life film. Certainly seeing it in IMAX 70mm influenced that feeling, but the film truly felt massive. The non-linear storytelling painted a world so complex and big. The cinematography not only enlarged the characters on the screen, but it amplified the consequences of their actions. The score was perfect. It never missed a beat, and the moments when you were thrown into silence was beautifully garnished by the sound of the projector clicking away over my shoulder. 

I know I’m not going to form a fully unbiased opinion on the film 10 minutes after coming out of my first 70mm IMAX showing in 6 years, so maybe I’ll save that for another time. But what I do want to say:

* The acting was phenomenal. Everybody just melted into their characters so well. RDJ was so great. He was so fucking great. 
* The story also worked well. I liked the ever-present theme of the movie where Oppenheimer was making all decisions rationally, and the others in his life would be corrupted by selfishness, pride, or power. Not to say that’s how it actually was, but it worked as a lens to view through the eyes of Oppenheimer. Nolan made a big deal of the fact he wrote this in the first person, and it showed. 
* I can see why some people preferred the first 2/3s of the movie and didn’t like the last 3rd as much. I still liked the climax and conclusion of the film, especially the ending with Einstein, but that may be something I reconsider when I’m less biased. The non-linear storyline worked, but perhaps it could have been better edited differently. 

Anyway. I’m super happy I got to see it in IMAX 70mm. I’m seeing it again that way on Saturday and will likely return for all the other filmstrip souvenirs. I don’t want analog projections to die and am glad this movie was so good since it makes a great case for it."
98,"I thoroughly enjoyed the endless list of bit players in this.

The guy from Numbers, the guy from Band of Brothers and Han Solo working for Strauss, Lucky Number Slevin, Freddie Mercury, the glasses guy from Full Metal Jacket, the Joker's henchman in The Dark Knight, that Hereditary guy..."
99,"That scene with Oppenheimer giving speech, while background rumbles and shake is too good"
100,[deleted]
101,"The last scene of the flashbacks near the lake was just incredible. It culminates the entire debate and emotions of nuclear technology used as weapons.

First flashback the audience is made to believe Einstein is upset at Oppenheimer. Second flashback looks like Einstein is upset at Strauss. Final flashback we understand Einstein was upset at himself. It’s the whole debate of who do we blame for everything surrounding nuclear technology. Do we blame the theorist (Einstein), the creator (Oppenheimer), or the user (Strauss). We see all three conflicts in 3 flashbacks to that one scene. Just brilliant."
102,Don’t know why but Einstein suddenly appearing after the taxi pulled away cracked me up. He was like the hype superhero cameo showing up once an act lol
103,"My wife and I really liked the film. We're Asians who were invaded by the Japanese during the war and seeing the leadup to the trinity test and the explosion was a very emotional experience for us, so much so that my wife wept knowing how much it had actually affected our history; both for good and bad.  


I also really liked how Einstein was like a magical Wizard in the movie throwing some sage advice from time to time."
104,"The speech where he begins to walk around the ashes of the people who were nuked was really fucked up, and the Trinity test scene was intense to the point where you could hear a pin drop while everybody was watching the test beginning.


The last 10 to 15 minutes are probably some of RDJ's best acting i've ever seen, absolutely goosebump worthy performances all around"
105,Jason Clarke was so hateable in this. Very frustrating character but goddamn what a performance.
106,Marvel style JFK name drop cracked me up so much.  I think I've over-consumed capeshit
107,"Can’t believe that when Oppenheimer found his catchphrase he was looking at tiddies, that’s crazy"
108,"That ending was a real kick in the pants. What a line. When Oppenheimer was like ""I'm here to see my gynecologist"""
109,"I liked how the script incorporated a lot of small things that get passed around as part of legend, like how Kyoto was crossed off the target list because Henry Stimson had a honeymoon there, the student who dramatically interrupted his haircut to go tell Oppenheimer about the successful nuclear fission experiment he read in the paper, the poisoned apple, the making a bet on total ignition of the Atmosphere, and so on, but I was surprised there wasn't a scene about Fermi accurately estimating the yield of the Trinity test with just some tiny papers, the wind, and educated guesses. Can't include it all I suppose.

The way the movie first incorporated the famous ""I am become Death..."" line felt for lack of a better word *tacky*."
110,"This did not feel like 3 hours at all. 

No weak links, everything about this movie is incredible. Cinematography, score, acting and the visuals of atoms colliding throughout the movie. Had a very anxious feel throughout the whole thing. 

Also the first time I've seen a line for the men's bathroom after a movie."

112,"Cinematic Masterpiece.

Alright, now it’s time to watch it again to try and understand who was what… and why who was mad at who… and why so and so was suppose to be someone important.

Should have paid better attention in 7th grade history."
113,Did anyone else feel emotional during the actual bomb test when it was going off? Jesus Christ the way he mixed sound and editing did such a great job making you feel tense.
114,"Am I over thinking the scene with Jean where they talk about the Bhagavad-Gita?

In the scene in which Jean (Florence Pugh) asks him to read from the Bhagavad-Gita, he starts by trying to explain the context that Arjuna finds himself, but Jean says she wants him to read the words. So he does, ""I am become death, destroyer of worlds"".

I don't know if any of you have read the Bhagavad Gita, but the context Oppenheimer is trying to give is that Arjuna doesn't want to commit to war against his kin, but Lord Krishna (an incarnation of Vishnu) convinces Arjuna that it is his dharma (i.e. ""duty"") to wage war.

The fact that Jean tells him to stop explaining the broader moral quandary that Arjuna finds himself in, and just read the words, seems similar to the expectations laid on him within the military context. It also, of course, reflects broader ideas around ""duty"".

Edit: I welcome any criticisms of my thoughts from members of the Hindu community. It has been a long time since I read the Bhagavad-Gita, and I'm going from memory."

116,"No one’s talking bout the Kitty visualizing Jean riding Oppie in the testimony room scene?

That was very Shining/Kubrick esque. Didn’t think Nolan had it in him to go “there”. 
Bravo"
117,"That opening with the Prometheus quote is genuinely one of my favorite things ever

Just brilliant"
118,"""We're taking Kyoto off the list because I vacationed there once with my wife. Nice people"" 

I haven't been enraged by a movie in a long time but that sure did it."
119,it was made clear that the more terrifying prospect is that Oppenheimer genuinely doesn't know how much of what he did was for his own personal ego and his desire to be remembered versus his moral qualms.
120,"Cillian Murphy felt like even if he was making eye contact with someone, he still had that 1000 yard stare.  He really carried this movie."
121,"The filmmakers knew they only had so much screen time to convey the horrors in Opp's mind when he thought of the victims and they did it *so* well. Shocking and horrific, and also refreshing and new considering what an archetype ""nuclear blast victim"" is in cinema."
122,Edward Teller making a paper airplane as Oppenheimer is talking with the other scientists is one of the funniest things to happen in the background in such a serious film as this.
