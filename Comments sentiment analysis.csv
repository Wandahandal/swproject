0;ive been working in software for nearly  years for the last  ive worked with agile teams i dont recognize agile any more xb when we started it was about making life better for the people that created the software with extreme programming it was yeah lets focus on that stuff that we know is important quality clean code taking time to clean up when things got messy and recognizing the things we all knew were true that customers frequently changed their minds so creating huge long term plans was often a waste of time xb now its exactly what the article said an agile industrial complex most of the scrum masters or agile coaches i speak with these days have never been software developers how can that possibly work the focus has shifted from developers to executives mostly because executives can pay those sweet sweet consulting contracts and scrum mastersagile coaches measure themselves based on how many lego games they know as opposed to understanding the problems their teams are facing or researching new ci techniques or god forbid even being able to demonstrate how to write a good unit test hell atlassian is even offering a jira administrator certificate aimed at scrum masters for fucks sake xb i want to say to developers that for some of us at least it used to be about actually helping you guys i dont blame you if you dont believe me xb edit thank you for the gold stranger ;{'neg': 0.068, 'neu': 0.785, 'pos': 0.146, 'compound': 0.953};('NEGATIVE', 0.9980510473251343)

5;agile is structured the way it is for a reason it is a software development process framework tailored to the needs of the business remember the business in general does not favor  quality beyond a certain very low threshold  craftsmanship  your ability to concentrate  your time being spent on development rather than administrivia  your personal development as an engineer the business does favor  transparency of the process to management  management being informed of progress towards the goal at all times  management being able to change directions and set new requirements at any time  metrics  everybody being on the same page  accurate time and money cost estimates  low risk profile  conformance to industry best practice  a large talent pool to draw from  as low a salary for developers as possible its like i said whatever it may have been in the past agile is today mostly a failed attempt to emulate one good developer with an array of average developers companies want to get good developer results with the developers they can get at the salaries that they are willing to pay _and_ mitigate the risks of good developers such as low bus factor they hope to get it by sharing the cognitive load of a difficult programming task among several such developers by keeping them in a state of continuous communication and continuous kt this continuous kt bit also figures in the transparency to management bit of the deal and is the stated reason why you dont get an office or even a cubicle anymore just a patch of desk in a loud busy room the unstated reason being that such arrangements make for an easy affordable panopticon edit when i say the business doesnt favor something what i mean is not that no business values these things plenty of businesses claim to and some actually put their money where their mouth is but when it comes right down to the wire the things in the first bullet list will all be sacrificed to preserve the things in the second simply because the ceo doesnt care about you how you work or how best to get more value out of you hes playing dimensional chess using entire divisions as pawns;{'neg': 0.057, 'neu': 0.846, 'pos': 0.097, 'compound': 0.9443};('NEGATIVE', 0.9338138103485107)

28;ok i read and i am still not sure what is the problem mentioned in the article  anyway i feel that most teams agree that frequent delivery accepting and responding to change or close interactions in and between teams are important some of the scrumish ceremonies are also generally accepted as beneficial so the question is why do we have to insist on putting a name and rules on a process even if it doesnt fit our context  i see safe and referring to it as agile as a great example of abuse maybe its a necessary evil in big organization but what does it have to do with agile  the same way im fine with agile team managers sometimes a team cant efficiently self organize for many reasons but why call it agile ;{'neg': 0.088, 'neu': 0.803, 'pos': 0.109, 'compound': 0.0042};('NEGATIVE', 0.9759941101074219)
29;my clients mostly dont have a methodology explicitly to me most of what i see looks like agileish i know its not real agile but it seems to pass for it in some places but its actually more like design by running in circles like a headless chicken theres constant spikesolutions happening for demos and deadlines and they all get rewritten because coding happens before requirements are complete at a lot of places ive been and of course when youre doing design by insanity automated testing doesnt happen frequent small git commits is just a shoegaze band name idea not something you actually do to me agile is what you do when the plan isnt working the best methodology is to plan things and get all your infrastructure in order when the plan is working you do that when the plan isnt working you need better plans and i suppose when nothing is happening at all it might be better to actually write some code instead of planning it;{'neg': 0.051, 'neu': 0.856, 'pos': 0.093, 'compound': 0.7129};('NEGATIVE', 0.9999964237213135)

33;in my experience the only scrum masters ive ever worked with have been terrible theyve all been failed business analysts who knew a tiny bit of sql theyve always been so dogmatic about agile that they slow down development with days of meetings and make arbitrary deadlines for barely functional sections of work and believe that being agile means we shouldnt do any kind of technical design work i actually like the ideas of agile and what it set out to do but unfortunately i feel like ive only ever experienced a poor mockery if you read robert martins take on the current stake of agile he explicitly states that scrum master was never meant to be a full time position but instead a rotating role between members of the dev team to me it seems like a lot things agile sets out to solve can be solved by an efficient well designed process  clientpo wants to see deliverables more frequently fine have your cicd continuously deploying each commit of the develop branch to the development servers and give them access to that thats a much quicker feedback loop that some arbitrary  week goal  clientpo wants to be move involved in writing taskstickets fine they should describe the desired behaviour of the system to a dev who can transcribe that to a series of technical tasks  clientpo wants to change requirements in the middle of development get them to pair programme alongside the dev ive just been burnt too much by bad scrum and poorly scoped tickets that ive given up on agile actually working for devs;{'neg': 0.064, 'neu': 0.836, 'pos': 0.099, 'compound': 0.8209};('NEGATIVE', 0.9985789060592651)

45;the problem is businesses are shitty and no amount of you are shitty lets create a system that gets you out of the way apart from the parts you need to do will help pointless having agile when you have businesses where nontechnical people will insist on solutionising but wont take responsibility for prioritisation or proper production of decent requirements never mind actually managing stuff like technical debt sometimes getting a straight forward this first that later is next to impossible in most businesses it is always this officially this via email chains because i dont want my name attached officially requirements often end up being driven not by technical need but by who shows the least resistance  of businesses suck at it and will actively seek to work around any attempt to make them not suck agile was an attempt to par down the whole field to this is what needs to be done on your end to not suck this is what needs to be done on our end and since it came about businesses that suck have tried every which way to violate those core principles heres the reality of corporate it  management will avoid making firm requirements so they can pass the buck  management will avoid giving hard prioritisation because theyve promised everyone the world  management still has people who insist they know something about technology these are the three beasts that must be slayed to make development work;{'neg': 0.114, 'neu': 0.798, 'pos': 0.088, 'compound': -0.7442};('NEGATIVE', 0.999862551689148)
