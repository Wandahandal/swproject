0,for a film with such sad violent deaths the mother meeting her ancestors was such a beautiful scene
1,mollies mothers death scene was incredible so well done
2,one detail i notice is when ernest interrogated by tom white and his men flies are associated with him and prominent in the scene to the point that ernest tries to swat it as if theyre attracted to him a fly also lands near him during the scene when mollie tells him that hes next as theyre in the house when the fields in hales ranch is on fire
3,the amount of information scorsese packed into the scene when earnest walks off the train is just amazing the social dynamics are completely topsyturvy for the era it was set in seeing white chauffeurs and white men sitting around waiting to jump on a truck for work was just uncanny and lets you know exactly what the situation is
4,so sad how the funerals started out  osage culturally and by the last funeral of the film they were void of any osage tradition
5,molly inadvertently showing hospitality to byron after he just killed her sister destroyed me
6,i love when ernest is trying to get the insulin box from the doctors his daughter elizabeth is hugging his leg and clinging onto him its pretty adorable to see moments like that in a very serious and tense film like this
7,one of my favorite things is that tom white jesse plemons character shows up in like the last hour of the movie and with very little effort he figures out what happens its not that the conspiracy was masterminded and brilliant people just didnt care to stop it
8,i love how easy it was for the fbi to piece it together literally just asked a witness off the street and they pretty much wrapped up the case right there
9,whats the reason that these independent educated and wealthy indian women keepon marrying the white man even after all the suspicious death what was the historical context that made these indian woman marrying white man that are clearly significantly below their social class
10,who else cracked up every time de niro had his goggles on
11,fuck a duck
12,absolutely incredible how good deniro is at  years old dudes been doing this for  years and still throws  miles an hour
13,i cracked up in the theater when dicaprio dapped up that kkk member lmao like oh yeah of course these motherfuckers are racist
14,lily gladstone was absolutely amazing and stole the movie
15,i love that scene where mollie imagines hale coming to finish her off
16,once again scorsese has a scene where the main character has to point to de niro from the witness stand got a chuckle out of that
17,who had leonardo dicaprio getting spanked by robert de niro on your bingo card for this year
18,well i wanted to make sure it was legal before i do it in reference to murdering children my theater simultaneously burst out laughing while going jesus fucking christ at this scene
19,funnily this felt like such a personal story to scorsese nearly four hours long and there is no glitz no glamour no big needle drops no crazy camera moves he put himself in the backseat and let the story and the tragedy carry itself throughout the film that is until the very ending at first i didnt really enjoy the ending it felt jarring and out of step with the rest of the movie but i think it cements the theme of the entire movie as the movie develops we see time and again how the white people continually try to exploit the osage people they have money and white people far and wide come to try and sell them things try to scam them osage prices rob them marry them and murder them they are dehumanized treated as inferior and turned into a type of sick game by the colonizers so the story builds and we get to the trial we have seen all of the immoral and evil actions hale and burkhart have committed we have the two wellknown actors playing the big whig lawyers about to duke it out in a climactic court scene where we will finally get to see justice and then it cuts to a new scene a scene that is not simple but instead a scene that is dynamic and energetic that shows you all of the behind the scenes tricks to making a fun and entertaining story and you realize that there wasnt any justice william hale ernest and byron all essentially got away with their crimes and instead of it being remembered as a tragedy the story of the murders was again exploited by white people and turned into entertainment and while scorsese is clearly affected by the story he puts himself on the stage with the other exploiters as he recognizes that he too is using their story to create entertainment however i think his transparency goes a long way to reinforce his overall theme that native american people have been exploited robbed dehumanized and murdered by european colonizers for hundreds of years and it continues to this day
20,the scene of the mother dying and being welcomed to the after life was absolutely beautiful and may end up being one of my favorite scenes in a scorsese movie that being juxtaposed with the sadness at the funeral and feeling the impending doom thatll be brought down on the family was overwhelming
21,that was  hours and  minutes of me feeling like shit for lily gladstone
22,i personally thought it was a really bold cinematic choice to have the movies most dramatic moments scored by taylor swift faintly playing in the next room
23,the scene where de niro basically said the hotdog car meme were all looking for the guy who did this when he offered to add  dollars to find out who killed mollies sister
24,if theres one lesson to take away from this ignorance and evil are two sides of the same coin the big question the film asks is where ernests stupidity ends and his complicity begins but ultimately they take you to the same destination
25,i just realized the connection between the owl the osage see right before death and hales owllike appearance with those round glasses this movie was so good
26,i appreciated that they didnt shy away from the brutality when they lifted rita and the back of her head was gone having to see and listen to annas skull being sawed off the atrocities are sickening and those scenes made you sit with it
27,nobody leo in the last m 
28,is there a word for that was amazing and incredibly difficult to watch were the funny moments actually funny or just not so damn heavy it made them seem funnier i dont often get excited for movies and i almost rarely go to movies and havent been on opening night since lotr but damn that was worth the hype imo
29,this film redefined why de niro is one of if not the greatest actors who ever lived he embodied fucking satan in this
30,ive seen a few reviews that say the movie is cold and keeps the viewer at an emotional distance but i teared up several times lily gladstone was such a strong presence and her breaking down every time she lost a family member was hard to watch also the scene where her mother dies and is led away by those three spirits hit me pretty hard also jesse plemons showed up so late into the movie that i had forgotten he was in it i really loved the change in momentum when he and the fbi come into the story the movie was expertly paced in that regard
31, year old jesse plemons calling  year old leo dicaprio son in the last act took me the fuck out haha
32,very confused why the couple second scene with the dead dog was left in there non book readers would be very confused in the book if memory serves correct the dog is killed so that they can plant the explosives in the house without being detected the book actually takes time to explain it
33,this and the irishman really show how scorceses evolved with portraying the main criminals compared to his older works where theres still a level of coolness to the gangsters even with the films indicting the characters and lifestyles here theres none of it ernest is just pathetic a stooge for his uncle that can only follow orders like a good soldier much like frank in the irishman maybe the funniest scene is ernest getting spanked with a masonpaddle by robert deniro even the redeeming factor of he loved his family is gone because he only loves them because thats what a good man does all while compartmentalizing that with killing mollys family and slowly poisoning her theres no more glamor only ugliness to the criminals it was always there in scorcese films now hes done giving them a veneer to hide behind
34,when molly let out that primal scream on the steps when she found out her sister died man that hit me hard emotionally she sent chills down my spine and ive never instantly teared up in a movie like that before amazing performance
35,this has been mentioned a few times already  having the epilogue play out as a hokey radio play funded by the fbi with actors putting on osage accents and cheesy sound effects with marty the white narrator himself coming out to deliver the closing powerful line was such a fucking necessary moment of self criticism and reflection an incredible level of selfawareness from an  year old scorsese just keeps on growing
36,can you spot the wolves in this picture chefs kiss
37,the old guy who really fucked up the murder he was supposed to do and then told the fbi you boys better grab your pencils when he was about to lay it all out reminded me a lot of harry dean stanton a very harry dean stanton coded character
38,i wish they talked about the detective that got thrown off a train
39,history spoiler i guess is that even a thing disappointed that they didnt include the bit where ernest tried to have his wife and kids stay at ritas house when it was blown up they only survived because his son had an earache and they couldnt leave came into this really curious at his they were going to go about that like i guess they left it out to avoid making him seem too evil but why include the bit about the earache then
40,man that last scene between leo and lily was heartbreaking
41,watching ernests reactions to the bombing and the fire insurance scam man you can see how much hes affected how horrified he is you keep praying for him to finally do the right thing and he just never does
42,it is very long but i dont know how it could be cut it was a very tragic story
43,the scene in the mason lodge with the reflection of a chess board in the glasses was some really cool symbolism
44,it was an incredibly thoughtful movie i will admit the movie is long but i was super interested in all of it without question its a very wellmade movie but more importantly its just a shockingly insane and tragic story im glad nolan was the one to tell oppenheimers story and im glad it was marty who chose to tell this one
45,im in love with the balance of dialogue in this film it was an absolute masterclass in wordless emoting and nuance the moments that tell you the most about a character are often when they say the least scorsese omits subtitles in some scenes so youre scrutinizing leo and lilys faces and suddenly you realize you didnt need the subtitles to understand leos more relaxed charming expressions in the first act are juxtaposed hard with his contorted confused suffering grimaces in the final hour lily conveys unimaginable heartache with simple glances down to the very last of her scenes honestly this was some of the best acting ive seen in my life there might be three academy awards for performances here so much of less is more is put on display its stated explicitly as a trait of the osage  they waste no breath when it isnt necessary and william hale spends the whole film yapping
46,man i got chills and teary eyed when marty came out at the end lily gladstone killed it i felt the film suffered a bit when she was so sick because she wasnt in it enough i loved how she was very traditional but yet super modern almost the way she laughed and flirted and stuff i mostly had some technical issues that brought me down a little some choice edits the scene of one of the osage man getting killed that looked very day for night people have mentioned the music score and i barely recall any of it was mostly amazed only two people in my theater left for a bathroom break and one woman left with about ten minutes left in the film
47,i havent read the book but was there some underlying point of ernest being below iq i have no idea how to phrase it but even when he is talking with hale at the beginning and even throughout he seems so clueless as to what is happening around him that its almost spun as if he wasnt in on it that may have been a filmmaking choice but for the first hour to hour and a half he seemed like he was on the side of the osage and strings were being pulled that he couldnt see the only reason i drive that point home is because he was so taken aback by signing away his rights should he basically be needed to be killed how could you not see that coming should it come to it the guy is a piece of shit but it felt like the movie was too sympathetic towards him if that makes sense
48,its only implied through a quick line de niro has something like did he say it was me but the book outright states that it was likely annas unborn child was hales
49,friendly reminder that william king hale was a real person who actually did all that
50,between jack white jason isbell and sturgill simpson the actors in this would make one hell of a band
51,underrated moment is the initial tribal council where they announce the reward money and appoint that guy to go to washington the tribal leaders absolutely crushed their two brief moments in the film
52,scorsese is alive now into his s and yet he has not stopped riding the lightning as a filmmaker the ending to this movie still has me spiralling an hour after seeing it the sheer scale of this horrific and disgusting time being reflected upon and then used as the ultimate weapon at the end is one of the most powerful endings to a movie i have ever seen i honestly believe this is one of if not the best movie martin scorsese has ever made it may very well be my favourite dicaprio and de niro have rarely been better gladstone will win an oscar the pacing the writing the cinematography all contribute to make such a harrowing and brutal story come to life and remind us to defy king hales insistence that people will forget i have not felt so impacted by a movie since i watched  years a slave for the first time im dead serious
53,lily gladstone was just the most perfect in this role her regality her beauty her strength and compassion were expertly played i would be hard pressed to believe there will be a more oscarworthy performance this season im curious if anyone else knowing scorseses catholic roots felt like there were virgin mary vibes with how he portrayed molly or was it just me either way just a great job and personally worth watching it just for her cant wait to see the next thing she does
54,i see why people didnt like frasiers acting in this but honestly i loved it i just love a theatrical grandiose lawyer hamming it up for the jury and for his clients you dumb boy
55,saw this in tulsa tonight  osage ladies had me take their picture before the movie with traditional skirts and blankets was honored to take the picture
56,i really liked that last scene with ernest and molly i was thinking the whole time its over they both have to know that how the hell could she ever forgive him but she really looked ready to after all that she recognizes that he loves her she gives him a chance to tell the truth lay it all out and start again insulin wrong answer
57,how about that score that deep delta percussion with light harmonica almost like the stones had a part of it perfection
58,scorsese did a great job differentiating the movie from the book i read the book in anticipation for the movie and would recommend it to anyone that enjoyed the movie the book is more structured around the fbi investigation and tom white whereas the film is moreso a story about mollie and her family  not to say the book doesnt cover it it does but id say it had the opportunity to expand further on the fbi due to the benefit of a written medium overall however the movie was incredible and its amazing to me that scorsese can continue to make these thoughtful and expertly crafted movies at his age the pacing was fantastic and there wasnt a time i felt as though the runtime was not justified did anyone notice that there was background music playing for almost every scene i wonder if that played a role in flowing the movie together from scene to scene without it being abrupt or jarring
59,nobody gunna talk about how molly ask the potus to send for help and then responds with maybe  words and sends a dozen fbi agents to figure the whole thing out thats why they called him silent cal
60,not to be nit picky but did anyone notice that the soundmixing seemed a bit off there were a couple of scenes that sounded like they had to be redubbed
61,anyone else have the next theater over blaring taylor swift for  and a half hours i will always remember this film as the one that had the taylor swift soundtrack during the quiet scencesaka most of the movie
62,one thing that really struck me was that this movie felt like an anticrimeprocedural two references really sprang to mind for me finchers zodiac and kurosawas high and low zodiac is similar in that its this sprawling hopeless investigation with matteroffact depictions of brutality and very controlled formal techniques high and low came to mind because of that scene where tom white plemons was standing around with his team and they were laying out their conclusions intercut with the scenes of them conducting their investigation this is very similar to the legendary middle section of high and low both these movies are procedural movies that really sweep you up in the process of investigation and accumulation of clues and details that lead you towards a cathartic conclusion in zodiacs case i guess that there really isnt a conclusion but scorsese strips out this procedure and mystery entirely where the book functioned as a procedural in the same manner as something like zodiac at first i was kind of frustrated by this decision as the investigation in the book really exposed the level of the conspiracy and how hopeless it all seemed whereas it kinda feels like white swoops in at the end here and wraps it up relatively easily but i think this was a purposeful decision by scorsese to completely rob you of any and all catharsis that could be experienced by watching an investigation be conducted and succeed instead were forced to just sit in the agony of following these horrible people bumble their way through these crimes and completely get away with it its like wolf of wall street if you just stripped any sense of glamor and flashiness from that film so you were just left with the worst most horrific parts
63,i am pretty annoyed they changed that ernest had meant to blow up the rest of his family his own wife and children when he blew up his sister in laws house that was a big reveal at the end of the book when his son admitted his father thought they were going to stay over there the night the explosion happened
64,did anyone notice that the audio became pretty bad at some scenes there was one scene i remember where it sounded pretty bad clearly adred where leonardo yells repeatedly at the guy to do the kill job immediately
65,the cameo with scorsese at the end was honestly one of the best and most memorable ending scenes ive ever seen in a movie
66,i want all factual epilogues in the future to be done in the way marty did it wow that was actually a phenomenal and heartfelt way to play out what happened to everyone from this story in addition just incredible performances all around especially by lily leo and deniro they were all magnetic in their roles and while it can feel a bit fascinating at first to see leo and deniro acting together like uncle and nephew they blend in perfectly by the halfway point when the semitwist is revealed as to how involved leo is with the kings behavior absolutely unbelievable what scorsese can still do at  i feel honored i can still watch new films from him cant wait for the wager
67,my lame claim to fame is that the son of my moms yoga instructor plays mollie and ernests kid
68,there is so much sorrow in lily gladstones eyes she plays this very stoic seeming character but every time i saw her i could feel the weight of every death and betrayal in her family feels like the first hour of this gives away what martin was desiring with the rest of the film preservation the history of the osage told through a book photos capturing just the faces and clothes of the people and their joy as they played sports or enjoyed luxuries all of these forms of preservation juxtaposed with their mass murder theres a beautiful narrative told to display the planned and systemic destruction of a people a statement to show that this was not something done naturally over time there was no slow replacement or natural shift in people it was deliberate planned and agreed on conspiracy by coyotes to shift wealth from one hand to another i personally found the ending so moving and effective it was a major risk to end this massive story with something as simple as a reenactment bringing the films own worth into question it feels like there was supposed to be another ending but scorsese wanted it stated plainly these people existed they suffered and then they were tossed aside and buried in the sand of history
69,simply blown away stunning sickening film while i was more entertained by oppenheimer id argue this is the better film on a quality level scorsese has seemingly unending energy to keep making films bless him but this would very much work as his swan song  this may well be the best performance ive seen from leo ive always loved his acting despite agreeing with the notion that he performs the same way in everything but he completely disappeared into this character the way he transforms ernest from this seemingly slow gullible halfwaycharming troublemaker into a way more sinister presence was hypnotic to watch  dicaprio is strongest during the movies third act where scorseses camera really studies his face in long unheld shots and lets it tell the story it begins with the scene when he gets arrested and detained while still sobering up and continues to when he denounces hale gives his testimony a truly stunning scene and finally that breathtaking final scene between he and mollie  lily gladstone holy crap the beating heart of this horrifying tale scorsese is deadon that her eyes communicate an entire world atop what the script and direction afford i assumed from the marketing that shed be this toughasnails nobullshit character but gladstone imbued mollie  indeed a person of deep intelligence and resolve  with a remarkable gentleness and sensitivity which made her story all the more tragic her only crime was trusting ernest and for that she was given a life of loss and suffering and still loved him until the terrible truth finally came out  mollie surviving was the biggest surpriserelief of the film i read varietys review from cannes a few months ago and they spoiled the fact that ernest poisons mollie which i thought would be some gutpunch reveal ending in tragedy it was of course agonizing to watch her slowly die at ernests hands and my heart sank every time they showed her getting worse assuming it would end inevitably but it instead served as the basis for mollie finally learning what a spineless bastard her husband was a small yet palpable victory in what was otherwise a grotesque miscarriage of justice  robert de niro was _the devil incarnate_ in this film just a stirring performance i was especially impressed by how he never turned hale into a mustachetwirling villain he was just slimy underhanded and entitled brazen in his evil and pathetic in his conniving ways rather than build up his villainy through scary monologues or violent outbursts like in his gangster films scorsese used the other characters weaknesses to reaffirm hales own power hale simply had to manipulate other greedy weak bigoted men into doing his bidding and spends most of the movie sweettalking the other characters into doing favors for him the crimes of course get increasingly grotesque and unconscionable  very interesting seeing two acclaimed country musicians sturgill simpson and jason isbell get prominent acting parts here and effortlessly hold their own against powerhouses like dicaprio and de niro i especially loved simpson great screen presence felt awful for isbells character  the spanking scene was fucking hilarious felt like a callback to when jack nicholson beats up dicaprios alreadybroken arm in the departed but it was way more comical the way scorsese set it up as this frightening cultlike initiation made it even funnier  those two doctors were a reprehensible nasty pair wish we saw them brought to justice i thought one of them the one with hair was the dude from the first mission impossible movie whos there when tom cruise hangs from the ceiling but i checked the cast and its a different actor  the scenes where hale sets up both blackie and aceys downfalldeaths was incredible the one scene in the movie that most resembled scorseses gangster movies  the moment i saw scott shepherd playing ernests brother i knew hed be bad news they always cast him as these villanous creeps and he nails it every time though i was lessthanimpressed with his acting on the last of us  brendan fraser and especially john lithgow were great in their limited screentime plemons usual deadpan act fell a little flat here but he was by no means bad and i loved seeing his whole squad finally dismantle the conspiracy  like oppenheimer the other threehour epic released this year this movie did start getting a tad tedious in the third act which again focused more on legalpolitical matters the editing in particular got a bit loopy in the way it kept jumping between the trial the jail cell and mollie as well as yanking ernest in and out of jail but it all came together in stunning fashion in the final segments i didnt expect ernest to have any kind of turnaround whatsoever so his testimony was a pleasant surprise  that whole radio show conclusion was totally surreal there were pieces discussed there that i wouldve loved to see play out onscreen despite the movies already huge runtime but it was an incredibly unique and potent way to end the film scorsese showing up on camera was a wild moment and speaks to how this film works as an excellent sendoff should he decide hes done making films there was palpable real emotion on his face as he read out what happened to mollie  the other thing that made this movie stand out in scorseses filmography was its moral clarity most of scorseses other movies are rather morally grey but this was a crystal clear indictment of an unspeakable evil that was slowly and consciously perpetrated upon innocent people scorsese has made a career out of dismantling americas favorite myths  the lawless gangster days the decadence and greed of wall street  and now he takes on the legacy of this countrys foundational sin  the western setting the macabre murdermystery plot and the theme of using religion to influence systemic corruption all reminded me quite heavily of true detective while the focus on crimes against indigenous tribes reminded me of wind river which is also told in a very atmospheric slowburning neowestern style scorsese can really nail any and every genre a master for sure
70,lily gladstones weeping during the mostly silent framescene of her mothers death is by far one of the most beautiful and memorable shots i have seen all year the production on this film was colossal
71,oppenheimer  killers of the flower moon villains with glasses that embody four eyes zero soul to their core
72,embarrassing questions  what are they holding up in the first scene of the movie  why do they ask leo to leave the funeral
73,this movie was a true epic long and reaching but paced well incredible performances and a truly tragic story of murder and systemic betrayal honestly a great director doing true crime is the kind of shit i like and this did not disappoint what i cant get away from with this movie is just how abhorrent these crimes were and scorcese knows just how to depict them to make them a true gut punch but remain respectful to the victims this isnt just murder its systemic genocide and theres not really a scene where everyone meets and plans this grand conspiracy all the white men just kind of know what their end goal is and they befriend and marry these people just to treat them like livestock and use them for resource lilly gladstone is going to be on every shortlist for acting awards this season and she absolutely deserves it this whole movie is terrible awful things happening to her and her family and while we know whos doing it we still feel her deep paranoia and mistrust what an awful feeling that must be to be afraid to eat in your own house and to look around one day and realize that half your community has been leading you to a slaughterhouse for money harrowing stuff and she puts it all on her shoulders it took me a minute to start getting on board with this movie i did feel like the trailer made it seem like an investigative movie so i kept waiting for plemons to show up which happens at the two hour mark but after seeing the whole picture its much more disturbing that we know whats happening the entire time its actually so refreshing when plemons does show up and start asking simple questions like youre telling me this man was married to your deceased sister and two weeks later he married your other sister its crazy how brazenly and blatantly in public and daylight these crimes were carried out all it took was for someone to be assigned to care to finally come around and put two and two together and how quickly it all started unspooling as soon as that element is introduced to the county i liked how the guy assigned to kill the melancholic started to become friends with him and its the fact that he had to force himself to do the murder that made him forget to make it look like a suicide a small glimmer of humanity in what is otherwise an awful story of communal evil whats depressing and far too real about this movie though is exactly what de niro says people will forget because no one cares the final scene of the radio show really got to me not only the mention that mollys obituary never mentioned her story but how marty showed up to give a kind of personal care to those final words its awful that things like this and the invoked tulsa massacre arent taught anywhere and instead explored on podcasts by people who have to dig up this information the ending really brought that home for me  rreviewsbyboner
74,who were the racist old people and random other white people at the burkhardt residence during the scene where the old people chastise the kids for being half savage you just see all these people milling about in their house and then never see them again
75,pretty surprised people are upset that it changed the focusstructure of the book i enjoyed the book its an important story and grann has good prose but its a pretty bythenumbers police procedural scorsese isnt interested in doing a longer episode of law and order focusing on molly and ernest is much more compelling
76,oh my fucking god theres so many things i can talk about dicaprio has maybe my favorite performance ever no one was prepared for how good de niro was in this film gladstone had probably the best nonverbal acting in the film her presence spoke louder than everyone else i know he had one of the weaker performances in this film but fraser getting work inherently makes me happy the occasional weird editing was the only issue i had but my god that ending thats the thing i want to talk about the most it completely changed the purpose of the film the commodification of the horrors of native americans and crime in general really just struck me and i feel like that was the point especially with scorseses role in it before his line my main takeaway from the film was the greed of humanity and how it struck the osage people but after that line i realized that this film wants to be about how our understanding and treatment of native american history is broken and this is just a small case in a history of horror i genuinely want to pursue more native american history after this and i feel like thats what scorsese wanted all along this film is just a small step in what he wants and how he wants to make the world better
77,jesus i found that one shot near the end of the film so haunting molly shows such kindness to ernests brother as he comes home late at night setting him down on a pillow and tucking him in juxtaposed with the casual coldness of what ernest had been doing that evening the way he and his accomplice to it with such a lack of regard and then slip away shrug off the magnitude of it just a really brilliant bit of editing and directing
78,i loved the shot of all the detectives gathering at night to share what they found
79,best de niro since casino truly heartbreaking the only issue i had with the movie was the score that played the entire movie got a little distracting loved the religious imagery scenes like the owl and lizzie passing away supporting cast was stellar the what happened after scene at the end was awesome them touching on the tulsa race massacre was a good megaphone for the themes of the film would be a little hamfisted in the wrong hands
80,felt like watching an entire season of fargo
81,jesus its been a long time since a movie made me so angry ernest is such a fucking reprehensible scumbag its incredible lily gladstone fucking killed it btw
82,surprised i havent seen anyone talk about hale saying he was as innocent as a newborn baby very funny coming from a guy whos catholic
83,man this one got me this is what studios need to spend m on  enabling the absolute best directors actors and craftsman alive to tell important stories in an engaging cinematic way this was just so fucking great i dont know how anything beats this out for best picture
84,i enjoyed how well this portrayed the attitudes at the time and how indian territory was viewed i personally appreciated how not all the spoken wazhazhe ie was submitted as an osage person and language learner living in texas i was probably the only one in the theater who understood some of those dialog exchanges i appreciate how something like that can speak to different audience members in different ways theres also so many details and particulars that people wouldnt notice as important or uniquely osage unless they had that cultural context and i like that those are just there but not over there explained you either know or you dont and that really makes it feel like this move was made for us
85,david lynch cameo at the end of the fabelmans  martin scorsese cameo at the end of killers of the flower moon
86,well boys get out your pencils
87,scorsese always has a way of wrapping up his films by bringing the theme all back home what was a harrowing day by day hell for the osage people was nothing more than an advertisement for cigarettes at the end it was a story told to entertain but commented on how thats so often all that it is i found it very appropriate then that marty himself got the last line about mollies obituary here was a film made with grace that took the time to see the ordeal from the perspective of the people whose ordeal this was in the first place i wasnt expecting it but i just wept at the end all that death and it ended up being for nothing there was no mention of the murders
88,what scorsese does at the end of this film is fucking incredible dont want to spoil it but only a director of his confidence and talent could pull it off
89,ernest the whole movie 
90,if i had a nickel for every film i saw this year with a charismatic friend of the protagonist with gray hair and glasses who was secretly a nefarious narcissistic villain played to perfection by a dude named robert who is definitely up for best supporting actor id have two nickels which isnt a lot but its weird it happened twice
91,i spent most of this movie not fully getting ernest as a character kept wondering if he was just simple if he had some other motivation it wasnt until the last act that it hit me hes just a piece of shit theres nothing else no dialogue that i didnt hear no subtext in his interactions that i didnt pick up on my confusion came purely from not believing someone could be such a piece of shit
92,leos turn into billy bob from sling blade two hours in was something
93,i know a lot of the talk with be of how good leo was but man i really was captivated by de niro every scene he was in a faces covering faces sort of performance
94,if youre seeing killers of the flower moon this weekend be sure to stay through the end credits there are two postcredits scenes teasing scorsese phase  and tying together the entire mafiaverse
95,i thought this was an absolute masterpiece this thing feels gargantuan in scope and the level of uneasiness and dread throughout is almost unbearable at times leonardo dicaprio and robert de niro are both fucking fantastic de niro is the best hes been in  years probably but lily fucking gladstone is transcendant i loved everything about this and will be going back before it leaves theatres 
96,shout out to the score at some point during the second hour i became horrifyingly aware that that heartbeat bass track was sucking anything good and holy out of me
97,saw this tonight lily gladstone dominates there is a cold dark evil in this world
98,want to share my thoughts after seeing this movie this is from the perspective from someone who read the book recently and was absolutely captivated by it the movie was great however i felt as if i left the theatre with something missing the acting setting cinematography camera work was all excellent these events took place over the course of many years so i understand the challenge of how you would have to cram all of this within a  and half hour film while they do a great job with it i think for the sake of telling the story some of the events could of been left out and viewers could of been left with a more flowing narrative when you read it from david granns perspective it reads like a mystery you dont know right away it was hale because he was big figure that appeared so generous and active within the community part of you thinks ernest would never do these things to his family or spouse the movie took a different approach with the story starting off right away showing who the protagonist would be and focusing on hale di nero and ernst leo they obviously got the majority of camera time in this story should they have that could be debated the story of the investigation and fbi could of been a movie of itself i know martin s had to chose what perspective and narrative to share with the viewers i think they could of focused more on the story being told from the osage perspective i did catch some parts where they shared some of manipulation around when they were doing things like buying cars or getting photos taken everyone was in on taking advantage of them the movie was great but wanted to share some little points i could spend hours talking about other aspects of the film or ways this story could of been told
