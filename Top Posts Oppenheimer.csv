1,Sex scenes,I read it‚Äôs finally streaming on Tuesday and I want to watch it with my family. I‚Äôll probably get it from iTunes. I would like to skip the sex scenes and full frontal nudity scenes. Can anyone tell me at what time marks these scenes appear? Thanks.
2,‚ÄúAm I seated or am I standing? Quantum physics says it‚Äôs both. How can it be both? It can‚Äôt. But it is.‚Äù,
3,Still blown away...,"Just watched it at home and even on the small screen, you can't take your eyes off the movie, the tension is still palpable, the music soars and I got goose bumps at the end...3 months later. I'm already pissed other movies are getting Oscar buzz. This is THE MOVIE."
4,Who‚Äôs this?,
5,Kenneth Nichols despawned,
6,"First words, ""Dr. Oppenheimer"" Last Words, ""I believe we did""",
7,I love the way they (Nolan? Lighting tech?) obscured Casey Affleck's pupils with the catchlights to make Pash appear even more soulless and intimidating than any performance alone could convey.,
8,This showed up in Duolingo today...,Saw these two in a single German lesson today and it brought smiles to me!

11,Would you guys say Oppi is nolan‚Äôs best film?,been debating it since it released but after a dozen rewatches it‚Äôs still amazing i have to say it is his best work.
12,Oppenheimer and black panther soundtrack all day! Shit was my summer,
13,haakon chevalier was a chad,
14,Just happy to be part of it,
15,What could Oppenheimer not do without his security clearance DURING the war?,"Him and Nichols go back and forth about him getting his Q clearance and he eventually had to get Groves to step in to get it.

 My question is what did this enable him to do that he couldn‚Äôt previously? He was already the director of the project and could travel around to the other sites. Obviously having a security clearance is beneficial for him, and after the war it‚Äôs what allows him to stay involved in policy discussions, but during the war what did his not having it mean for him?"
16,Cillian Murphy and Margot Robbie have been paired up for Variety's Actors on Actors,
17,"Barbenheimer was great, Oppie then Godzilla Minus 1 is even better","Just got back from G minus 1, such a great companion to Oppenheimer if you want a really full picture of the nuclear horror.

Obviously, Godzilla is not in the same world or genre, but damn they did such a wonderful job on that film making you really feel the horrors that Oppenheimer did not show."
18,Proud to be a fan,
19,Is anybody else having difficulty playing UHD on Xbox?,I‚Äôm trying to play the 4K blu-ray version of Oppenheimer on my Xbox and it just won‚Äôt work and I can‚Äôt find any work around. Has anybody had this same issue? Xbox Series X.

24,The New York Film Critics Circle | Oppenheimer wins for Best Director & Best Cinematography,
25,Best audio settings for at home viewing?,"I‚Äôm underwhelmed by the audio watching the 4K disc. My setup is decent - PS5 to Sony eARC TV and soundbar but without an atmos track on the disc, the sound to me is very flat and the voices are muted. It sound doesn‚Äôt pop as much like when I saw it in the theater. I‚Äôve been toying around with setting but can‚Äôt seem to settle on what‚Äôs best. Anyone have a better experience and can share their set-up and settings?"
26,Looking for a clip,"Does anyone have the clip of Oppenheimer and Grooves together before the explosion as Oppenheimer tells Grooves the remote possibility of destroying the world? 

Would like it please for an edit."
27,Anyone else??,I didn‚Äôt realize I listened to him that much!
28,Nitpicking Truman's Oval Office,"I visited the Truman Library and Museum in  Independence, Missouri a couple of years ago.  The museum includes a replica of Truman's Oval Office, so I was looking for details in the scene where Oppie visits the then president.  There are some photos of the museum online and we can use them to compare to the film clip:.  
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UkOaVABeOv0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UkOaVABeOv0)

First off, I see the portrait of San Martin, who liberated several South America countries from Spain on the wall to the right of Truman at the 26 second mark of the video clip of the scene.  This portrait is also in the museum.

You can also see the large portrait of George Washington over the fireplace at 3:18, but there is a small controversy here.  The museum likewise had the large George Washington but it is flanked on either side by the portrait of San Martin (see earlier in the scene) on the left and Simon Bolivar, who also liberated several Spanish colonies, on the right.  However, there is at least [one photograph of Truman's office](https://lessthan3ley.wordpress.com/2015/07/21/pictorial-detective-work-in-the-truman-library/) which has the portrait of Simon Bolivar prominently displayed in the center over the fireplace.  Allegedly, Truman was against colonialism which would explain the prominent placement of the South America liberators.

There is some other trivia, such as the large Earth globe seen at  1:04.  This was actually [made for President Roosevelt](https://blogs.loc.gov/maps/2018/01/the-presidents-globe/) to help visualize the distances and scope of troop deployments during World War II. 

There is no bookshelf in the museum Oval Office, but presumably Truman was a voracious reader.  In the film clip, you can see some books lying on their sides, perhaps capturing this aspect of the former president, and agreeing the [observation on Truman's bookshelf made by this blogger,](https://lessthan3ley.wordpress.com/2015/07/21/pictorial-detective-work-in-the-truman-library/) 

I don't know the story behind the aircraft pictures on the wall (at 32 seconds, to the left of Oppie)  but they too are present in the museum.

Any, TL;DR, I suspect the set designers used the museum as a source, and while maybe not 100% accurate, it is very good reproduction.  I also suspect the designers decided to replace the Simon Bolivar portrait with George Washington's to either be consistent with the museum's presentation, or perhaps to avoid confusing American viewers who would wonder why Bolivar's portrait would be center and larger than George Washington's."
29,Oppenheimer (Chronological Cut),
30,Finally saw this today even though Nolan is one of my favourites,"So expectations were high. To the point i fully expected to be underwhelmed.


But maybe im riding the high but holy damn what an experience. It makes me consider buying a bluray player to experience this as best as possible again.

Josh Hartnett yesss! Hes back and i love it.
Gary Oldman what a surprise!
RDJ... holy damn, oscar nomination for him? 
I did not know Tom Conti, but i absolutely LOVED his Einstein, i dont know how to put it in words but every scene was so captivating, how he embodied the character.

Cillian Murphy, well i hate to be one of these guys, but i liked him before he was cool! Great performance, but no surprises there, man is talented."
31,My Oppenheimer mementos,"Theater lobby displayed poster. 
Unleashing Oppenheimer hardcover book. 
4k steelbook. 
Screenplay. 
Imax 15/70mm film strip. 

Becoming my favourite movie, every time i rewatch it. Wouldve bought the amazing soundtrack on vinyl but i dont have a record player."
32,Did the scientist know the target of the bombs before their completion?,"At the beginning of the bomb building process, Oppenheimer demonstrates the amount of Uranium and Plutonium that is refinined by using marbles to fill a glass bowl and cup. Assuming that once they are filled they have enough to build 2 bombs.

Did the scientists already know that they were commissioned to build two bombs for military targets? Or was this simply illustrating they have enough to build two bombs.

Or was this a story telling tactic to foreshadow the construction of Fat Man and Little Boy. And In that case, how did the scientists already know they needed two bombs for Japan when Germany hadn‚Äôt yet been defeated. 

I‚Äôm all twisted up on this one and likely overthinking it."
33,What changed Rabi's mind?,"For all his hand-wringing at the end of Act 1, why does Rabi eventually participate in the Manhattan Project?"
34,TFW you realize where you know Rabi from‚Ä¶,"ü§Øü§Øü§Ø

P.S. this doubles as an appreciation post for how great a character actor David is."
35,Young Einstein and Oppenheimer.,Does Hollywood uses the same wig for them?
36,Possible theater return this month according to AMC app and IMAX website,"I believe we... will get a chance to see the movie in theaters again. 

Let's hope it includes some IMAX 70 mm run, though I know that requires projectionists. 

Fingers crossed."

40,"What's the next movie, nolan gave hint in oppenheimer?","We know his movies are somehow connected. You can see the atomic bomb looks similiar to that of dark knight rises. Also the detonation scene looks like nolan is taking preparation from 2012. We have heard oppenheimer's name in tenet and then we get Oppenheimer. 

Possibilities I think :

1. JFK - John F Kennedy. He was mentioned. Nolan may cook something. Although there is a full blown movie on JFK 

2. Teller? Dont know. 
3. Future nuclear warfare? Don't think so
4. A masterclass horror. Because the basketball court scene and also the interrogation looks like a nolan preparation for higher scale. Surreal. I think split personality horror with hallucination and delusions might work in a immersive plot.
5. A sci fi not related to his previous works!?  

What you guys think?"
41,Who thinks Boris Pash hire Klaus Fuchs?,"I was watching a scene from Oppenheimer on YouTube I did saw Oppenheimer at Cinemas. When the scene when Boris Pash is talking to Oppie I thinking about what if Boris Pash hired Klaus Fuchs like the story General Groves told Oppie. Like Groves was saying Pash is very suspicious kind of guy. Again it‚Äôs a theory reason why is a Russian spy in Los Alamos.

Do you think this is a good theory?"
