51,seen it twice now already trinity test scene was remarkable and what most people will see the film for but there are so many other great scenes some of my favorite  can you hear the music robert the scene where oppenheimer is told to leave cambridge and we seem him abroad looking at art thinking of the quantum world all while the beautiful score is played such a beautiful montage it happens early so its somewhat over shadowed by the later scenes but make no mistake i think its one of the best in the film  the dinner with strauss where they are discussing whether or not there was a spy at los alamos and if the soviets have an hbomb i love this sequence i love the way the music swells the back and forth between strauss and oppenheimer and how the scene ends with oppenheimer says something to the effect of there was no spy and strauss holds up the data sheet and says robert rdj delivery of that line was like music i love how everything was played during that scene and how it all culminates with rdjs delivery of that line  im taking kyoto off the list due to its cultural significance to the japanese people also my wife and i honeymooned there fantastic and harrowing scene where they discuss how and where to effectively use the bomb james remar is particularly great  the gymnasium scene after they learned of the horishima bombing this was nolan directing a horror film first of all i loved the use of a wide open aperture during this scene as it gave the scene a very shallow depth of field resulting in a dream likenightmare like appearance this might be cillians best scene in the film watching oppenheimer dissociate from the jubilation of the crowd as the reality around him begins to break down as the destruction and death he was responsible for begins to truly sink in i love how flat his rahrah speech is and the use of sound here is tremendous the stamping of the feet the sound of the crowd going out the sound of a woman screaming the crowd noise slamming back in like a bomb itself  the whole last hour is great but the sequence where roger robb is realllyyy starting to grill oppenheimer and the blinding light begins to fill the room acting and editing here was just unreal  the scene with pash casey afflecks line delivery is so soft spoken yet unsettling really tense scene  you can use a shovel for atomic energy in fact you do i loved that this film used a rashomon style narrative where we see the same scene over and over again from different perspectives and subjectivity one of my favorites was the scene where oppenheimer humiliates strauss in public over the isotopes i love when we first see this scene strauss appears to take oppenheimers jabs with good humor smiling and shrugging it off but when the true nature of strauss is revealed near the end of the film we see this sequence again and strauss looks so angry and humiliated also cillians line delivery during these moments were so good i just love how he says in fact you do  the final scene where we learn what oppenheimer and einstein really said to each other that day nolan understands set up and pay off so well you watch the film waiting for the reveal and it does not disappoint the final moment with the vision of the nuclear holocaust is incredibly bleak but much of what einstein says to oppenheimer during before this is so sad and god damn poignant watching oppenheimer as an old man receive a hollow award and receive handshakes and pats on the back from some of the men that stabbed him in the back or attempted to the way einstein sums up the burden of genius but also the way you will be taken for granted as you age,"{'neg': 0.077, 'neu': 0.718, 'pos': 0.205, 'compound': 0.9989}"

76,in my personal opinion the part thats meant to shake you is when oppenhiemer gives his speech when the war was announced over and the people were cheering but he also sees the destruction the bomb causes a crazy juxtaposition of the crowd not understanding the reality of the use of the bomb the movie was really trying to show that oppenhiemer truly believed that once the bomb was dropped once the whole world would be horrified and he hoped would be the end of the destruction so when he sees people drunk on patriotism he realized the chain reaction that would destroy the world was not a chemical reaction that he introduced but the chain reaction of drunk on power oppenhiemers ego made him feel godlike that he was all knowing and that he could create a peacetime but when truman blew him off and basically said im god oppenhiemer thought the politics and power hungry forces of the world would bring it to its end probably why he seemed relieved that the soviets got the tech so that power in the world would be dichotomas why the ending scene with einstein should haunt you is not any moral question of what was already done at that point but the understanding of the inevitably of science progressing and that each one of us has a responsibility of it after its here we are the chain reaction thats when einstein understood that his legacy would be tainted with the bomb because he started the chain reaction of understanding quantum mechanics so the moral question leaving the theatre should be we need to take this big leaps in science discovery with the care it needs before it runs away makes you think about who you are voting for how much tech you use and how we use ai the movie was a  but as an engineer that studied nuclear energy i am bit of a fanboy of the scientists involved it was like the art rennisance but for science the implications of discovery are still unraveling today ex quantum computing in the age of ai i already understood the science and what was happening and it was rewarding to get into the head of oppenhiemer and the politics and moral questions he had as a man maybe the movie rewards you more if you know more heading into the film due to the pace brilliant character study of one of the worlds most interesting people he felt the music he truly felt like a vessel of science and had higher devine purpose,"{'neg': 0.07, 'neu': 0.776, 'pos': 0.154, 'compound': 0.9933}"

78, arguably one of nolans tightest scripts it felt concise for what it was trying to do and has hardly any filler scenes  rdj was incredible i liked how he was kind of tony starkish at first and then he becomes more and more unlikable as it goes on hes the front runner for supporting actor this year for sure  matt damon was an unsung highlight he was hilarious and always gave great line deliveries  gary oldman as truman was a great cameo he was such a prick in only  minutes of screen time  the trinity test scene was absolutely breathtaking the tension followed by the silence followed by the sound was thrilling to experience  holy shit that scene with oppenheimer giving the speech in the gym and he hallucinates the bomb going off on the crowd genuinely one of the most haunting scenes ive ever seen  the score was fantastic ludwig deserves a ton of credit for building up the intensity with his score,"{'neg': 0.065, 'neu': 0.732, 'pos': 0.203, 'compound': 0.9811}"

96,the thing that stands out to me the most is how well the film portrays oppenheimer as a truly complex character that remains sympathetic throughout a really great performance from cillian murphy and an excellent narrative i also loved the string theory visuals they felt very real in a way thats hard to describe even though its probably not scientifically accurateknown,"{'neg': 0.018, 'neu': 0.711, 'pos': 0.271, 'compound': 0.9646}"
97,im a fan of nolan i was so blown away like many i imagine the first time i saw the prestige it changed how i viewed movies i stuck with him through the years and was continued to be blown away oppenheimer is a larger than life film certainly seeing it in imax mm influenced that feeling but the film truly felt massive the nonlinear storytelling painted a world so complex and big the cinematography not only enlarged the characters on the screen but it amplified the consequences of their actions the score was perfect it never missed a beat and the moments when you were thrown into silence was beautifully garnished by the sound of the projector clicking away over my shoulder i know im not going to form a fully unbiased opinion on the film  minutes after coming out of my first mm imax showing in  years so maybe ill save that for another time but what i do want to say  the acting was phenomenal everybody just melted into their characters so well rdj was so great he was so fucking great  the story also worked well i liked the everpresent theme of the movie where oppenheimer was making all decisions rationally and the others in his life would be corrupted by selfishness pride or power not to say thats how it actually was but it worked as a lens to view through the eyes of oppenheimer nolan made a big deal of the fact he wrote this in the first person and it showed  i can see why some people preferred the first s of the movie and didnt like the last rd as much i still liked the climax and conclusion of the film especially the ending with einstein but that may be something i reconsider when im less biased the nonlinear storyline worked but perhaps it could have been better edited differently anyway im super happy i got to see it in imax mm im seeing it again that way on saturday and will likely return for all the other filmstrip souvenirs i dont want analog projections to die and am glad this movie was so good since it makes a great case for it,"{'neg': 0.049, 'neu': 0.754, 'pos': 0.196, 'compound': 0.9972}"
