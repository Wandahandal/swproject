1,"The Message of this Film is Seemingly Missed, or No One Wants to Talk About it","So I live in LA, went to film school, and have lots of filmmaker friends. Oppenheimer is obviously the biggest talk of the town and has been for months. 

I've seen it twice, both in IMAX 70mm at the Universal Citywalk. It was amazing to behold.

Watching that movie left me in a state of stunned silence. The ending was so overwhelming. I wanted to talk about the implications of this movie. How powerful its message was.

No one else did. They wanted to talk about the IMAX camera, the all-practical visual effects, how they made the explosion look, the editing, etc.

Which, yeah I get that. And I suppose its par for the course because they're all filmmakers.

But every time I try to bring up what this movie was trying to say, I just get single-word reactions ""yeah"" or ""hm"", or silence and eyes darting away from mine.

And even the ones who do talk about it, they say insane stuff like ""oh it wouldn't destroy the world, not really""

I say ""But it would end civilization""

they snap back ""No it wouldn't!""

It worries me just how willfully ignorant people are about nuclear armageddon. This has to be one of the more important movies I've seen in that regard, and no one will talk about it.

There isn't really a question or ask in this. Just an observation which I find interesting, and a little un-nerving."

Does anyone have any idea about the chances that Oppenheimer will return to theaters in the same way it did this past week? Or is it only going to be sporadic showings at select theaters across the US/world like with interstellar?

Thank you."
11,Thoughts on the themes,"After my second viewing, reading the script, and lots of contemplation I keep coming back to the ripples in water colliding. Representing chain reactions, intended and unintended, are a way of life.

Thematically it struck me that while Oppie unlocked destruction of civilization, we have always had at the individual level been capable of our own destruction, ego being the fire from the gods. Oppie, after he talks to Einstein and before he pisses off strauss, sees his own uncontrolled chain reaction that will play out. And he becomes his own Prometheus in torturing himself through the Board review, in essence, igniting his own atmosphere. Oppie story splits apart at the end, like fission. He was put in a small box, pressured from all sides, arguably imploding when he states he was ‚Äúan idiot‚Äù (that time period for an academic to say that it was in the psychiatric sense that was an ableist determination of severely low intelligence).

Strauss‚Äôs story has everything come together at the end, like fusion. And like the h bomb, his result was big, public, and even more explosive than what he did to Oppie. And he was undone by a junior senator from MA that saw action in the Pacific with PT109. Not sure of the  veracity of that part of the story, but it is poetic someone who actually was in the Pacific and knew the cost of lives may have been what did Strauss in."
12,"Another comparison between the two masterpiece films. I'd like to get the subreddits thoughts on which ending, between Interstellar and Oppenheimer, resonated with you the most. Both are powerful scenes to say the least. ","On one hand, Interstellar's ending is emotionally brimmed with curiosity, hope, and discovery. Whereas Oppenheimer's ending is emotionally brimmed with despair, shock, and total powerlessness in regard to the chain reaction that Oppenheimer had started. They seem to be a Yin/Yang comparison."
13,Breathing Sound In Destroyer Of Worlds,"I don't know if anyone else has heard like that feint breathing sound before the violin starts, I am a Violinist and I've tried to recreate the noise by playing real soft with the bow, maybe its a sound effect or the mic picking up the feint."

While it does sound a bit funny before watching this movie I was loosing so much motivation for college I even thought of just giving up completely. Then the night me and my Father went to go watch it that scene where ""Can You Hear The Music"" came up and something about it sparked something in me. I became energetic and so happy and by the end of the movie (ofc no spoilers) Something about this movie just made me inspired to keep pushing onwards with my STEM degree and I am so happy I went to go see it opening day"
16,Prepping for Digital Release with Some Video Essays,
17,Los Alamos National Laboratory (taken today),Flying to Vegas and was able to locate Los Alamos from above. Not the best quality but l'm not complaining. Glad to see it even though it wasn‚Äôt up close.
18,Round 12 yesterday but I got there about 10 minutes after the showtime and it was already 5 minutes into the movie‚Ä¶so round 13 tomorrow,"It‚Äôs just xenon digital projection and not film so I was shocked that the movie started less than 15 minutes after the scheduled showtime, as last time I saw it on xenon here it started almost 20 minutes after the show time. Cant have my final showing be without the incredible opening sequence so im going back again tomorrow ü§£"

22,Oppenheimer trinity test scene with flashbacks?,Someone edited the trinity test scene to include the flashbacks of Oppie's quantum  visualizations and it looked awesome. Found it from youtube but somehow lost it. Would anyone be able to point me to that video if u have seen it?
23,What would be your Oppenheimer?,"Hear me out: 
You‚Äôre a superstar filmmaker with a 100 million dollar budget and you have free rein to make a 3 hour movie about any historical person or event. What obsession are you bringing to the big screen? How would you do it? Who‚Äôs perspective? What format would you shoot on? 

I am genuinely curious because I truly don‚Äôt think I have one. I feel this level of intensity for mythology and would love to do a big screen adaptation of the odyssey, but as much as I think about actual historical events, I just don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs anything that captures me the way Nolan was captured by the story of Oppenheimer."
24,Oppenheimer is a Master Class on philosophy with an emphasis on objective vs. subjective reasoning (Spoilers),"Saw Oppenheimer for the 8th and probably final time in the theater last night and took away a much deeper meaning than I have yet.

The main message I think Nolan is trying to get across through the movie is this: 

***The reason the world seems to be going to shit is that we are trying to operate objectively in what is ultimately a completely subjective universe.***

The Gray Board was a subjective witch hunt trial masquerading as an objective security clearance hearing.

Strauss's ordeal was a subjective, political comeuppance trial masquerading as an objective confirmation hearing.

Classical physics is objective. There are rules. The universe follows these rules. We can predict things.

Quantum physics is subjective. The rules (sometimes) get thrown out the window. We cannot predict anything with certainty.

For centuries, we have been operating under a human understanding of classical physics, and it has shaped how we interact with the world. It helped usher in democracy, for example, the belief that there are natural laws and rules and we can and should be expected to live within these black-and-white rules.

But the more complicated the universe becomes, the more entropy that is introduced, the less black-and-white the world gets.

Quantum physics was absolutely revolutionary for the field of science. It completely turned pre-conceived notions on their heads. But the rest of our society has not yet caught up to the implications of ""the new science."" We have not learned how to operate subjectively.

The Gray Board hearings are a perfect example of this. The color portions of the movie dive as deeply as possible into the psyche of J. Robert Oppenheimer, and even then it's impossible to walk away with an objective view of the man. It's impossible to say he was a good guy or a bad guy.

Because that's not the way the world works, Nolan seems to be telling us. We have to stop operating in a mode in which we are judging people and putting them into these very specific boxes.

Oppenheimer was complicated. His motivations were complicated. His reasoning and rationale was complicated. He was imperfect, and yet a genius. He was a walking, talking paradox.

We have to be able to embrace paradox if we're going to survive as a species. We're not living under the old science anymore.

The ""Can you hear the music"" sequence, I believe, is Oppenheimer working through the dissonance in his head in which he views the world as subjective but is still living in a world that embraces classical physics. Throughout the movie, we see how subjective Oppie is in the way he views the world. He abhors boxes and labels. He doesn't want to be pinned down. He has a miraculous ability to change his mind at any moment, something that the average person in 2023 seems to be completely incapable of doing. We're all so set in our ways that it becomes polarizing.

Not Oppie. From a young age he saw through the classical physics and ""felt"" that there was something more to the universe. And once he heard Neils Bohr's lecture, it gave him some sort of hope that he was right. He studied science and art, read, learned, experimented and then finally saw ""through"" the illusion of form and objectivity. He saw the universe, finally, as subjective. And he found some peace.

That pursuit of the subjective followed him his whole life, and he bristled at the idea of black-and-white thinking.

Strauss, on the other hand, is a perfect model of supposed objectivity. He is a master politician. Think of what a politician is -- someone who is subjective (biased) but trying to pass as objective (fair, unbiased). He has a disdain for Oppie almost from the get-go, but he masquerades as someone on Oppie's side in order to keep him close. 

Once it is clear that he not only can't control Oppie, but Oppie is determined to undermine Strauss's politics, he decides to get rid of him by fashioning a subjective trial masquerading as an objective hearing.

This, naturally, drives Oppenheimer absolutely mad. He is back in his old world. A world of classical physics when he knows the truth -- that the world is actually subjective. Why are all these people behaving in a black-and-white manner when the truth is infinitely more complicated than this!!!

Even Kitty acts in this black-and-white way, constantly telling him he must ""fight"" the Gray Board, notwithstanding she was the one who encouraged him to appeal his security clearance being revoked. Perhaps this is why Oppie is attracted to Kitty -- opposites attract and her ability to ask and answer a question within the same breath is something he craves sometimes because the alternative is having to wrestle with questions that don't come with any answers, just more questions and tons of paradox. It must be exhausting to be him. 

Oppie is comfortable with nuance. The ""Fission"" portions paint such a beautiful, nuanced portrait of Oppenheimer. The ""Fusion"" portions are constructed in a way that blatantly asks us to pick a side.

I think this is the message Nolan is trying to send: We *have to stop* living in black-and-white and embrace nuance. In everything we do. In every interaction we have with each other. In our international relations. Otherwise, we absolutely will suffer the fate Oppenheimer fears in the final frame.

Seek less to judge. Seek more to understand. That's the legacy of Oppenheimer."
25,Trailers before 2023 fall reissue of Oppenheimer imax,Are they the same from the summer release or different ?
26,The timing for Oppenheimer was apt,
27,Man November 21st can‚Äôt come soon enough‚Ä¶,
28,One very important person is missing!,"In the entire movie, I never heard the name ""John von Neumann"", although this Einstein-like genius was one of the central figures of the Manhattan project. (if you dont know him, just look at his wiki page, dude was a machine who was multilingualist , contributed a lot to mathematics, was chemical engineer and a mental arithmetic master)

Is that just because Nolan wanted to feature relatively known scientists like Szilard, Einstein, Fuchs and, of course, Oppenheimer?

In my personal opinion, von Neumann shouldve been at least mentioned, also if this movie is in big parts a biography of Oppenheimer, it portraits many of his colleagues and friends. von Neumann was a part of the Target Comitee to choose which city would be nuked and he personally calculated the ideal height to drop the bomb.

As I know Nolan as a director whose goal it is to dive deep into the subject and present his viewers a deep movie, I am a bit dissatisfied. What do you think? Do only scientists who are relatively well known deserve a place in this movie ""for the masses"" or should he at least be mentioned?"

47,Oppenheimer's final message not that effective...,"This most likely is just me, but it's also something I've noticed with reactions to this movie in general.

At the end of the movie, as Oppenheimer is haunted by visions of nuclear war, the message is pretty clear: The bomb may have helped us now, but we may have doomed ourselves by doing so. 

This is more or less consistent with the reactions I've seen, especially by people on this subreddit. A general feeling of existential dread and impending doom combined with the inevitability of nuclear war- and the unlimited catastrophe associated with it. Usually this is also associated with ""World war 4 will be fought with sticks and stones"" and ""The only winning move is not to play"" being quoted and requoted ad nauseum. 

However, the movie's final message only leaves the impact that it should have if you do not believe in the value of nuclear deterrence. If you already believe in the peacemaking capabilities of the bomb or subscribe to alternative beliefs regarding nuclear war, **the movie** **doesn't tell you anything that you don't already know**. 

If anything, the movie's portrayal of Oppenheimer makes characters like Teller, Pash, or even blatant antagonists like the Federal agents that interviewed Oppenheimer more sympathetic and, in some cases, the ones in the right. That's not a slight against the movie, on the contrary, it gives credit to the nuance Oppenheimer was portrayed with. Despite that, it still somewhat reduced the impact of the final message. 

Unless, of course, I'm misinterpreting the whole thing, but those are my thoughts on the matter. "
