0;I'm afraid climate change is going to kill me! Help!;feeling scared have you been listening to or reading sources that make you think climate change will kill  you  your friends and loved ones  all of humanity you arent the only one here are a few recent posts about that very thing here  here  here  here  here  here  here  here  and here  there are even older ones but this is a good start this post will be updated from time to time as community members develop answers related to concerns like these until then please read through some of the threads listed above ;537; feeling scared have you been listening to or reading sources that make you think climate change will kill    you  your friends and family  all of humanity   you arent the only one infomercial vibes so i know this is a late response to this thread but i hope some people see this xb reddit is for the most part not a great place for nonbias sources as you can probably tell it is very bias towards a democrat viewpoint which i believe for the most part is actually very logical most of the general viewpoints are realistic and good but the specific information written in a headline as a hyperbole because of the bias imo this is actually pretty good especially because its scientifically backed because of this it makes people who were on the fence much like myself and many others i know about voting much clearer but because of this going to reddit for world news specifically climate change is the equivalent of using webmd to diagnose yourself there is a lot of truth on there but all you are going to do is make yourself more anxious by looking at it what i recommend is looking up reputable sources even if a little bias bbc ipcc etc if you are really interested do what you can to help and vote for who will help the situation but dont let yourself get caught up in the mad max in  years scenario these scenarios are based on a worst case scenario and even then its fishy asf where we dont use technology to help what we have and also assumes we burn the maximum amount of fuels as the us and other countries make transitions to cleaner energy other developing countries will still be using coal and fuels it is very likely we will not phase all fuels out in time but we are also developing technology to help it out all thats left is for us to vote and stick it to the people who are against green policies as long as you do what you can rest assured worst case scenarios will be avoided assuming nothing absolutely crazy irrational happens and im not saying this to make you complacent i urge you to make strides not only to improve yourselves but the world for us and the next generation humanity has so much potential anyone saying its already lost is lying to themselves hopefully i helped someone out with this i struggled with this for the past  or  weeks as a recap i came to terms with it by realizing that a we arent in a worst case scenario and the methane permafrost loop has debunked multiple times and is only accepted by very few scientists even if it were its solvable b as much as people claim bullshit on this statement its true as humans we have the ability to adapt to an extraordinary amount of circumstances we can and will adapt however if we want to live in a future similar to today we need to take action as soon as humanly possible get climate change skeptics and deniers out of office do what you can yourself to improve your life and make the changes you want to see in the world also the more you help your community the better your area will be if worst comes to worst c this is just general life advice but live your best life you can do so being as green as possible but live your best life find love have children teach them the importance of life and how to learn from past mistakes find something you love and whole heartily enjoy doing unless aging is cured or somehow the singularity pops we are all on a limited lifespan the universe is vast and whether heaven or hell or nothing at all if you live your best life youve done everything you can xb thanks for reading my wall of text i really hope you strive to be who you want to be and fix the world in the process   climate change isnt just going to pop up and murder people youre going to have a long period of economic decline where people get really really unhappy and thats probably where you will see the greatest chance to make large gains in the big ideas to combat climate change ill say it again and time will prove me right reduction is not going to be enough to stop a couple billion people from dying you need to take active measures which effectively include offsetting the geoengineering of  billion people living on the planet with some type of geoengineering that helps keep earths climate in check there really isnt a natural solution scenario here climate is not that stable humans developed in a window of an ice age and cooling trend and much of the planets history is quite the opposite so even the most ardent environmentalist needs to admit that this climate that were all used to is destined to change and essentially murder most of humanity sure maybe it wasnt going to happen for another  million years but that was then and this is now the natural course has been interrupted and its going to take an artificial effort to correct it beyond out of just reduction even the natural cycle of  years of cooling in  years of warming is not something that humanity would be able to come anywhere near surviving at todays population levels if you embrace the idea that we can just reduce and let nature fix things youre still embracing reduction of human population as one of your primary solutions since were going to need technology to keep this planets climate anywhere near the threshold that humans are used to over the last ten thousand years i think everyone just needs to get used to the idea that were going to have to actively tweak the climate well beyond that of what nature would do because at the end of the day natures big plan is to eventually make humans go extinct in the more shortterm model the predictions of massive economic decline caused by global climate change as well as billions of peoples lives being put at risk is also a good reason to not put all our eggs in the greenhouse gas reduction basket unless of course youre okay with the inevitability of billions of people dying as part of your solution were going to have to actively attack co and methane and pull it out of the atmosphere and perhaps even block solar insolation from adding so much heat to the planet in  years or so were going to be at a catastrophic level of climate change that causes massive economic decline and global instability and almost certainly world war and thats only about  years away i dont believe even if we met reduction goals tomorrow that we would stop rising temperatures from releasing even more methane over the next few decades and then youre going to have to face that temperature spike and essentially unknown amounts of methane release and damag ecosystems the biggest climate threat of co is that its going to release the methane stores which will have a far more profound and rapid impact than just co so the problem will become exponentially worse and thats why i taking extreme measures is going to become the more and more obvious option im sorry were going to have to geoengineer the planet but technically we already did when we build all these houses and roads and farms all im really saying is youre going to have to geoengineer your geoengineering ive been getting downvoted for like a decade for saying this convincing that many people and that many nations to meet reduction goals is probably actually a much more difficult goal than just engineering co and methane and ocean acidification down to levels that we can deal with and yes as ridiculous as it sounds blocking out the sun a little bit is going to become a more and more practical idea its not nearly as bad as it sounds and volcano is essentially naturally do it all the time but it clearly still has to be coupled with reduction and that should go without saying if your scientifically minded enough to even understand this post im disappointed about how many supposed environmentalists and climate change activists dont want to hear anything but reduction and minimalism to me it seems like youre dragging your feet and risking billions of peoples lies even back in  you were probably inevitably on this path where you needed technological solutions to manage the climate beyond just reduction because the worlds a big place with a lot of developing nations and theyre all going to go through intense periods of pollution were still barely focused on agricultural pollution and very much obsessed with fossil fuel pollution and thats not really the full spectrum solution that you would need even if bet everything on reduction youve been able to cut back your meat consumption for decades and have far more impact than buying an electric car or solar panels but what percentage of progressive liberals have given up meat you need to listen to the scientists and not just the journalist  is it unconstitutional to force climate change deniers to live in florida we can give them free property after  years they can sell it for a profit if it isnt part of the countrys biggest sandbar if they are right they win if not well you know its easyturn off the tv and go outside problem solved chicken little syndrome the climate of the earth is in constant change no matter what the cause be it volcano radiation from space solar fluctuations etc there are thousands of things that will kill you that are greater than climate change such as car accidents burning candles at home smoking drugs etc climate change danger from co is much less that most household dangers so you need to get this all in perspective sure we must do things to prevent climate change the best we can but over population of the earth is a much bigger threat to mans existence too much population for us to produce food for  years later there is a reason to worry now this post is  years old and still being used as an argument that everything is fine way to disillusion yourself and yet climate related deaths have plummeted  in the last  years globally my recommendation is pay less attention to wild conjecture and more attention to actual real world evidence i cant stop crying the past few months its really getting in the way of my activism and music career i plan to use to mitigate this my friends and family are worried because im in such a race to get good enough to make a difference i skip meals every day so i can practice and learn more about what we have to do my entire life is climate prevention mostly because of the less than  years to prevent runoff thing these corporations have insane technology now that all our smart devices are connected to the internet any kind of action that will get this rich people less money will be shot down and the people exterminated by their goons i fear is there any hope carbon capture is what im trying to fundraise for is that a good use of my time in addition to political songs about electing proenvironment leaders also i have autism so im having a lot of trouble meeting people that care as much as i do glad to see that im not the only one and the people calling me nuts for believing this are possibly wrong
1;The r/climatechange Verified User Flair Program;rclimatechange is a community centered around science and technology related to climate change as such it can be often be beneficial to distinguish educatedinformed opinions from general comments and verified user flairs are an easy way to accomplish this  do i qualify for a user flair as is the case in almost any science related field a college degree or current pursuit of one is required to obtain a flair users in the community can apply for a flair by emailing with information that corroborates the verification claim the email must include  at least one of the following a verifiable edugovetc email address a picture of a diploma or business card a screenshot of course registration or other verifiable information  the reddit username stated in the email or shown in the photograph  the desired flair degree leveloccupation  degree area  additional info see below  what will the user flair say in the verification email please specify the desired flair information a flair has the following form username degree leveloccupation  degree area  additional info for example if reddit user jane has a phd in atmospheric science with a specialty in climate modeling jane can request flair text phd  atmospheric science  climate modeling if john works as an electrical engineer designing wind turbines he could request flair text electrical engineer  wind turbines other examples flair text phd  marine science  marine microbiology  flair text grad student  geophysics  permafrost dynamics  flair text undergrad  physics  flair text bs  computer science  risk estimates note the information used to verify the flair claim does not have to corroborate the specific additional information but rather the broad degree area ie john above would only have to show he is an electrical engineer but not that he works specifically on wind turbines  a note on information security while it is encouraged that the verification email includes no sensitive information we recognize that this may not be easy or possible for each situation therefore the verification email is only accessible by a limited number of moderators and emails are deleted after verification is completed if you have any information security concerns please feel free to reach out to the mod team or refrain from the verification program entirely  a note on the conduct of verified users flaired users will be held to higher standards of conduct this includes both the technical information provided to the community as well as the general conduct when interacting with other users the moderation team does hold the right to remove flairs at any time for any circumstance especially if the user does not adhere to the professionalism and courtesy expected of flaired users even if qualified you are not entitled to a user flair  thanks thanks to rfusion for providing the model of this verified user flair program and to uashotastheclimate for suggesting it;14;i really appreciate this initiative i hope that experts will take their flair mods of this sub are tackling a very difficult job in such an important scientific field i am grateful for their efforts is this because the sub is patrolled hard af i like this idea but im a little nervous about sharing my identity

3;Climate Change is Disrupting Animals' Brains. Here's How;;21;new research from cornell university sheds light on the adverse impact of climate change on the survival and reproduction of songbirds the study reveals that changes in temperature and rainfall disrupt the sensory worlds of these birds affecting their navigation and decisionmaking abilities this disruption leads to behavioral changes negatively influencing both survival and reproduction notably temperature variability linked to climate change contributes to more nest failures and reduced reproductive success cold snaps and heat waves associated with climate change pose a particular threat to nestlings making them more vulnerable to temperature extremes aerial insectivores birds relying on insects for food are particularly sensitive to these temperature variations the findings emphasize the potential longterm consequences for bird populations as climateinduced temperature shifts persist impacting breeding seasons and overall reproductive success source  i doubt many will care if animals can think straight when humans are dying from floods heatwaves and wild fires heck most people only care if their ham and chicken nuggets are going to be more expensive and not able to think much is probably not a bad deal for a pig or a chicken in an industrial factory farm conservatives thinking whats the dumbest way to react to this information really  well lets turn off that gigantic ball of fire in the sky shall we  more fear mongering of course it is think it might be a stretch that if climate change is affecting animals brains its also affecting peoples brains
4;Extreme weather in Brazil; today in rio de janeiro the weather sensation felt like  degrees there was a girl who had a heart attack associated with the hot weather during taylor swifts concert anyway these days are absurd in brazil;10;its ganna get worse before it gets better felt like  degrees f thats  insane oh boy that feeling in my spine and guts
5;Two grim reports on global climate efforts highlight increased fossil fuel subsidies, ill health;;30;report authors directly blasted the fossil fuel industry comparing it to tobacco companies and the banks that loaned them money all our indicators on the fossil fuel industry are extremely relevant because this is an industry that is actually killing people in large numbers and making them ill in even larger numbers said report coauthor paul ekins an economics professor at the university college of london the lancet report highlighted  countries handing out more than  billion in subsidies to fossil fuel companies in  the report from the world resources institute and others highlighted fossil fuel subsidies as one of six indicators that are not only off track but going in the wrong direction fossil fuel consumption subsidies in particular reached an alltime high last year over  trillion driven by the war in ukraine and the resulting energy price spikes said report coauthor joe thwaites of the natural resources defense council environmental group so oil companies admit that their products cause global warming so were giving subsidies to oil companies to drill while giving subsidies to green energies too smh heres pretty much how i have been successfully arguing with magats lately about switching to sustainable energy we need renewable to stablize gas prices and take geopolitical power from russia and the middle east my plan is  by   renewables by  by then renewables will be so cheap if your not on them you will be risking bankrupcy no maga people ive talked to have a counter argument on that yet ive also started arguing we need to eliminate p pollution from fossil fuel burning it beaks down the membrane in lungs at the blood air barrier keeping the pollution arguement as personal as possible makes it go over with them too also i argue china and india have big incentives to go sustainable too becuase neither have domestic fossil fuel reserves and dont want to pay for imports just to keep the lights on free market my ass report authors directly blasted the fossil fuel industry comparing it to tobacco companies and the banks that loaned them money they are not the same the tobacco companies would only dream of having the whole world hooked on their products heck most voters still prefer cheap gas to almost anything else today no wonder our green president begged opec more than once to pump more oil when the gas price is high it is not just the banks it is the consumers the voters the government it is everyone the only real monetary subsidies going to fossil fuels are consumer subsidies to help people afford energy for their homes the rest of the trillion dollars is an imaginary number assigned to the implicit subsidy of allowing the harmful emissions continuing to intermingle these numbers ambiguously is leading to a confused populace that thinks governments are handing them money to drill wells most people even those who are concerned about climate change still support consumer energy subsidies that keep people warm
6;Kauai became a clean energy leader. Its secret? A publicly owned grid;;2; fast response diesel turbine generation goes a long way to stabilize heavy renewable penetration the freewheeling ability they added to turn the turbine into a synchronous condenser is really cool though you see all these bs numbers out of germany south australia and california about  renewable days or whatever but kauai actually has to do it for real no import export shenanigans and no other grid to lean on for support that turbine provides all the reactive power for their essentially super large microgrid the population of kauai is just k  energy is still  cents per kwhr compared to  cents for oahu at  million with honolulu the us average is around  cents kauai got  inches of rain in one day in  surprised nobody blamed it on cc similarly the south pacific had it normally high  of typhoons that year hitting asia
7;Anecdotes from rural New England;i grew up in new hampshire somewhat near the gulf of maine and ive heard a lot about the gulf of maines unusually rapid warming i wanted to share some events happening here that may or may not be related to this ski resorts will sometimes hold early spring slush ski events where everyone just gets covered in mud and slush upstate these have gone from late april to march and im not sure if  will stay there in addition ski resorts are relying on fake snow earlier and earlier even at all times in winter which is incredibly scary for the state with the secondmost ski resorts only beat by california there hasnt been a proper shrimp harvest in years and lobster is declining too as they go north to canada nothing tastes the same as when i was younger my mother who grew up much further south talks about how much more snow she got back home than today when i was in school the snow days were everywhere all the time every year there was a risk or most often an occurrence of crossing over and getting more time in summer nowadays i dont think kids here get a week off summers arent that much hotter for some reason new englanders think summers were hotter in the past but i suppose it doesnt matter its noticeable however  highs arent super common though and new england still has the best summers in the nation imo everyone is dealing with more deer which eat flowers and damage flora i get a lot of you probably think they arent that problematic if youre from a city but theyre going from an occasional nuisance to yankee raccoons that will eat everything that isnt a tree just something i wanted to speak on a lot of people here probably come from cities and want to know what is happening out in the backcountry i think everyone out here knows winter isnt the same thankfully summers not a huge issue inland at the moment because of our abundant water supply and high latitude and im grateful to live somewhere that will be more shielded than louisiana or florida at least comment to me if you want more info or have any articles or something on whats happening in new england regarding climate change but before you stop reading this i know things will be better in the s the local nature was destroyed by paper mills the forests were cut and bare and the nashua river would run a different color everyday with all the dye and pulp dumped into it but the local governments and epa organized and the way the land looks is not the same as before but a drastic improvement to  hopefully my kids can enjoy it like people did in  before the mills came and hopefully thats a global thing;3;i live in alberta canada where we live it feels like we get almost no weather what i mean is it feels the same but much milder and almost no forms of precipitation it is scary i remember spending a night in berlin nh and the stank i couldnt believe how such a quant town could cope with that i live in nh and ma many years thank you for this i will treasure my memories of great blizzards with lightening and waking up to  feet of snow and hours of snow removal the warm meal afterward a cozy multi blanketed bed the warming and slight stink in the air its hard to witness i am  from northern italy and i can see parallels drastic reduction in snow in the plains see graph ski resorts moving to higher altitudes pollution improved wrt the s about the last point i guess the solution was moving industrial production to other countries eg china so progress is more local than global a difference is that our water depends on mountain glaciers and we are beginning to see severe summer droughts as ice in the alps is close to extinction
8;Climate change is causing mountain peaks that have frozen for millennia to collapse in huge landslides;;241;oh boy more good news  lifelong climber here ive seen this in action with numerous smaller slides and rockfalls that were once very rare slides that just a few decades ago were limited to summer late afternoons now occur in midmorning due to earlier ice melt lots of old routes are now simply too dangerous bbbut  i moved away from the sea to get away from rising seas is crushed in a landslide oh well at least they arent just removing the tops of mountains like they enjoy doing on certain mining companies fuck the valleys and forest below i guess and the rivers and sediments there was a thread on here recently and i argued that the idea that we use these weather events as examples of climate science with very little science behind this belief as the wrong approach to a massive issue and bad for climate science the incident was likely a result of thawing permafrost  and scientists have warned similar events are to be expected as climate change causes ancient frozen ground to degrade real good science dudes  just to add i am extremely concerned about climate change and its a real thing these types of non scientific articles though arent helpful because they are so full of holes damn im glad i dont live under any big mountains hmmm  kinda making molehills out of mountains test flair do not upboat this is from june seemed strange for this time of year in the northern hemisphere
9;Looking for good research papers based on tackling climate change using machine learning and artificial intelligence;hello has anyone read any good research papers where machine learning methods are used to deal with climate change preferably in farms and forest sector;0;
10;Plants are likely to absorb more CO₂ in a changing climate than we thought – here's why;;4;plants cant help when they catch on fire  because plants help fight climate change its essential to conserve existing plant biomass and restore lost vegetation yet we arent doing much to stop forest loss  thinking increasing co concentrations is going to be good for the plants is still an experiment we do not know this for sure that all plants will even survive this rapid co fertilisation experiment that is going on way faster than usually to be evolutionary adaptable it is a stupid generalisation also the argument also conveniently forgets ocean acidification and devastating ecosystem changes so it is flawed thereby this argument do not belong to serious discussions not fast enough lol
11;When has the climate science community experienced a moment of optimism?;as you know the early s are seen as a hopeful time in global politics marked by events like the fall of the berlin wall and the dissolution of ussr and there was the oslo agreement between israelplo etc  was there a similar optimistic moment within climate science perhaps with the establishment of the ipcc or the paris agreement  a moment that made people think  wow positive change is possible;1;

14;2 degrees, 40 feet: Scientists who study Earth’s ice say we could be committed to disastrous sea level rise: A new report details that ice sheets are melting quicker than expected, and that the world will need to ramp up its climate efforts to avert disastrous sea level rise.;;169;i just moved m higher no faith we will stop this my friends moved to nova scotia a few years ago they followed my advice and bought  feet above current sea level i suspect all this is just going to accelerate pretty quickly sooner than expected tm sigh imperial measurements for those who dont have a clue about imperial  feet   meters meanwhile boats  by the end of the century we could tell all the people living in beachfront properties that they have  years to move sucks but they are usually the people who most contributed to climate change good i say let the sea level rise let the rivers meet the oceans and wipe humanity of the face of the planet imagine how cool itll be for the alarmists to be able to say i told you so to the entire human race more scare tactics and lies blah blah blah  years ago they were saying the same thing we only had  years before the polar ice caps melted and sea level rose  to  feet never happened isnt going to happen waterworld here we come

16;What will life in a 3C world look like?;if we go with the numbers of the  un report the earth will warm about c by  what will life look like with this much warming;81;well it really depends on which tipping points are breached first in what order and how long their effects take to fully play out ive extensively studied various amoc theories in relation to the modern climate so i can give a pretty exhaustive analysis on what i expect to happen with that given what weve already got going for us my guess would be icefree arctic and permafrost thaw this would exasperate warming in the northern hemisphere with the potent heat trapping characteristics of methane and loss of glacial light reflection feeding a runaway warming effect itll probably happen before  between then and now well see glacial declines and growths but the pattern will ultimately point towards rapid glacial decline thisll result in whats known as a blue ocean event and the amoc i expect gradual amoc slowdown which would hit a minimum flow at the end of the century but the effects will not be what you think theyll be contrary to popular belief i predict thisll trigger rapid warming across europe and north america due to the implications of heat not being properly circulated from either the tropics or midlatitudes why the dynamics for a significant cooldown simply do not exist in the st century actually the complete opposite we have all the right or wrong conditions for runaway warming the cooling hypothesis relies on proxy analyses of what we believe happened in response to amoc slowdowns in the past the younger dryas is often used as an analog but it simply isnt comparable to the modern era the younger dryas had significant gargantuan continental glaciers in north america laurentide ice shelf and europe fennoscandinavian thus an amoc decline under such conditions resulted in these ice shelfs easily expanding southwards and triggering a cooldown in the northern hemisphere such extensive ice shelves simply dont exist now certainly not in the locations theyd need to be to cause significant cooling in response to an amoc decline the greenland ice shelf is the last remnant of this era and due to its geography is better placed to promote atmospheric blocking patterns across north america and europe the current cocktail of ghgs is already potent enough for us to observe realtime disturbances to atmospheric behaviours and by the time an amoc slowdown will be significant enough to have any considerable impacts its warming effect will already be rapidly outpaced by anthropogenic warming however theres a few important details to remember here the amocs warming tendency is mostly confined to the winter period and during the summer months it actually cools the climate across europe via precipitation and oceanic weather fronts moving in from a warmer north atlantic this is very evident across western europe where rainfall is a big feature of the climate and helps to maintain year round mild temperatures  not too cold in winter not too hot in summer when the atlantic is cooler due to a weaker amoc this creates an atmospheric domino effect that results in notably hotter and drier summer conditions across europe this effect is known as the cooloceanwarmsummer effect and has actually been observed a few times over the past decade most recently in  therefore a weaker or absent amoc results in a much more pronounced continentality effect and much hotter conditions across europe due to associated atmospheric blocking patterns in response to the colder ocean surface cont society will have collapsed for sure the amoc will probably have shut down completely changing the climate in huge parts of the world arctic will be ice free for long periods of the year antarctica will be melting rapidly heatwaves that are deadly to humans even in the shade storms not just hurricanes will be devastating tropical diseases will have spread to the subtropics and possibly further many animals extinct  is optimistic the current rate since  is c per decade we could see c by   famine diseases jumping species mass exodus from coastal cities the worlds average temperature was c cooler when milethick glaciers covered most of north america so a c increase would be well underway in making the planet unrecognizable  is probably a bit optimistic trumps administration did a report where they found a  expected by  these people are supposedly deniers and thats what they came back with publicly  maybe my beachfront property on baffin island will finally be worth something black cause well all be dead mostly extinct who cares about  when people are dying from heatwaves floods and wild fires today but if you want an answer  no one knows for sure what life will be like in  years just think about if anyone in  had a clue of what life is like today
17;Currently in Miami during a biblical flood;its november  the dry season and were currently getting a monsoon and tropical storm force winds that we had absolutely no warning about the prior few days it had been almost  in november with  percent humidity i guess all that thermal energy building up had to result in something lots of cars about to be totaled today and tomorrow from the floods;166;isnt it almost that king tide time of year too its almost like the ocean is rising up to swallow the whole place or something simple raise your hand over the sea and the lord will cause a strong wind to blow from the east splitting the sea and making the ground dry if that doesnt work take up kayaking few thoughts no prayers bye bye property ins in florida if youre in a biblical flood youll noah it global warming the weather channel was talking about it coming so there should have been some warnings here in az this is the first day our high has been under  since sometime in the spring shit is bananas the republicunts have banned reporting storms i remember a few years ago the fed offering to fund a sea wall around miami to better protect it they declined i guess taking the money would be an admission of climate change or something

19;Would it be possible to inject diatomes or phytoplankton into oil and gas fields?;i know injecting co is favored by industry but i think the exponential potential of microbial photosynthesis is far greater you could grow these organisims underground and the fracking that was done to many of these oil and gas fields has softened the rock so way more can be stored;6; photosynthesis    grow these organisms underground i dont think photosynthesis is going to work underground maybe chemosynthesis instead but what exactly is it that you want these microbes to do what are you smoking where is the light coming from
